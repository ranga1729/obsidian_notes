#### 3.1.1 Computer memory hierarchy
![[Pasted image 20250126221145.png]]
##### Primary memory
- Faster access.
- Limited storage.
- volatile.
- More expensive.
Ex: Main memory, Cache memory

1. Static RAM(SRAM)
	Cache memory in the CPU.
	Data kept as bits.
	The most expensive type. 
	Prefetching and pipelining techniques are used. 
	Speeds up the execution of program instructions for the CPU.
2. Dynamic RAM(DRAM)
	Main memory of a computer.
	CPU's space for storing application instructions and data.
	Low cost.(Compared to Static RAM)
	Less speed.(Compared to Static RAM)
##### Secondary memory
- Online storage solutions. (Like internal HDDs)
- CPU can't directly process data in secondary storage. They must be copied into primary storage first. 
Ex: Magnetic Disk, Flash drives, CD-ROM
- Mostly used for online storage of enterprise databases. 
- Less expensive.
- Measured in,
	Kilobytes(KB)
	Megabytes(MB)
	Gigabyte(GB)
	Terabyte(TB)
	Petabyte(PB)
##### Tertiary memory
- Removable media that can be used as offline storage.
- Large capacity.
- Comparatively less cost. 
- Slower access to data.(Compared to primary memory)
Ex: CD-ROMS, DVDs

1. Flash memory
	Non-volatile. 
	Categorized into EEPROM(Electronically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory)
	High performance.
	Fast access to data. 
	Disadvantage: Entire block must be erased and written simultaneously. 
	Two types, 
		1. NAND Flash Memory
		2. NOR Flash Memory
	Ex: USB flash drives
2. Optical Drives
	Ex: CDs and DVDs
	Capacity of a CD: 700mb
	Capacity of a DVD : 4.5 - 15GB
	
	CD-ROM(Compact Disk - Read Only Memory): Reads data by laser technology. Cannot be overwritten.
	CD-R(Compact Disk - Recordable) and DVD-R: Able to overwritten.
3. Magnetic Tapes
	Used for archiving and as a backup storage of data. 
	Magnetic Disks ranges: 400GB-8TB
	Magnetic Tapes ranges: 2.5Tb-8.5TB

#### 3.1.2 Storage Organization of Databases
- Databases store persistent data in the secondary memory. 
	Reasons,
	1. Non-volatile
	2. Large capacity
	3. Less cost per unit 
- Magnetic disks are wide used for database storages and Solid State Drives(SSD) are one of the latest alternative. 
- Magnetic tapes also used for database backup purposes. 
	Magnetic tapes required their data to be loaded and read before processing while magnetic disks can be accessed directly. 

- **Physical Database Design** is a process of selecting a data organizing technique for application requirements. 
- Data on disk is grouped into **Records** or **Files.**
- These records includes data about
	entities,
	attributes and 
	relationships.
- When a certain portion of the data is required, 
	1. It need to be found on the disk
	2. Copied to main memory for processing
	3. Rewritten to the disk of the data gets updated.
- Therefore, data should be kept on the disk in a way that they can be accessed quickly. 
##### Primary File Organization
Defines how the data is stored physically on the disk and how they can be accessed. 

| File Organization | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heap file         | No order. Appends new records to the end.                                       |
| Sorted file       | Maintain an order by sorting them on a particular field.                        |
| Hashed file       | Uses a hash function of a filed to identify the record's place in the database. |
| B Tree            | Uses tree structures for records storing.                                       |
#### 3.1.3 Secondary Storage Media
- HDD holds magnetics disks. 
- Basic unit of data in a HDD is the Bit.
	8 Bits = 1 Byte
	One character is stored using a 1 Byte. 
- **Capacity** of a disk : Number of Bytes it can hold.
- Disks are composed of magnetic material in the shape of a thin round disk.
- **Single sided disk** : Stores information only on one side.
- **Double sided disk** : Stores information on both sides.
- **Disk pack** is a pack of disks assembled together. 

![[Pasted image 20250127100835.png]]
- **Track** : Concentric circles of small width and with it's own diameter where information is stored on a disk. Numbered from outer edge to the inner edge of the disk.
- **Cylinder** : A group of tracks on different surface of a disk with the same diameter aligned together. 
- **Sector/Block** : Smallest units of data storage on a track which divides a track into fixed amount of data.
	![[d22a5711-2d48-495d-b86e-f31c37afcbf2_2000x1123.jpg]]
	Sector : Defined by the disk hardware and used by Disk controller directly when reading or writing occurs. 
	Block : A logical unit of storage defined by the file system(ex: NTFS, EXT4). and used by the OS/file system when reading or writing occurs.
##### Hardware components on a disk
![[Pasted image 20250127101605.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250127101729.png]]
##### Sector organizations on a disk
![[Disk+Storage+Devices+Different+sector+organizations+on+disk.jpg]]
- During the disk formatting, the OS divides a track into equal-sized disk **Block(or pages)**. Each block is size fixed and can not be adjusted dynamically. Block size is defined by the file system.


| ![[Pasted image 20250127104253.png]] | ![[Pasted image 20250127103227.png]] |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |


![[Pasted image 20250127103311.png]]
- **Interblock Gap** : Small empty space on a disk between two consecutive blocks(or sectors) on a track. 
	Ensures data block are physically separated and provides time for the read/write head to reset or prepare for the next block.
- **Hardware address of a block** : Uniquely identifies a physical location of a block on the disk. 
	Consist of,
	1. Cylinder Number : Specifies the vertical alignment of the block across platters.
	2. Track number : Surface number inside the cylinder on which the track is placed. Indicates which read/write head (platter surface) to use.
	3. Block number : 

> [!NOTE] Hardware address truly consist of,
> 1. Cylinder Number : Specifies the vertical alignment of the block across platters.
> 2. Head number : Indicates which read/write head (platter surface) to use.
> 3. Sector number : Specifies the sector on the track within the cylinder.
> Ex: `(Cylinder: 12, Head: 2, Sector: 20)`

- **Buffer** : Small, high-speed, memory area on the primary storage(DRAM) that temporarily hold data during read or write operations. 
	When data is read from the disk, it is first loaded into the buffer before being sent to the operating system. Data to be written is first stored in the buffer and then written to the disk.
- **Read commands** : Disk block is copied into the buffer.
- **Write command** : Content of the buffer are copied into the disk block.

![[Pasted image 20250127111329.png]]
- **Cluster** : A collection of contiguous blocks/sectors.
	Clusters simplify file system management by reducing the overhead of tracking individual sectors. Size of a cluster is depends on the file system. 
	Small files can waste space because even if a file is smaller than the cluster size, the entire cluster is allocated.
	Larger cluster sizes may lead to more wasted space (internal fragmentation), while smaller sizes increase file system overhead.
Ex: If a file is 6 KB in size and the cluster size is 4 KB, the file will use **2 clusters** (8 KB total) on the disk, leaving 2 KB of unused space.

##### Types of Read/Write heads,
![[Pasted image 20250127111840.png]]
1. Fixed Head disks : The read/write heads on disk units are fixed.
2. Movable Head disks : Disk units with an actuator connected to a second electrical motor that moves the read/write heads together and accurately positions them over the cylinder of tracks defined in a block address
	![[Pasted image 20250127112052.png]]

#### 3.1.3 Solid State Device Storage
- Known as "Flash storage".
- Store data without requiring constant power. 
- Internal components, 
	a controller,
	group of interconnected flash memory card
- SSDs can be plugged into slots designed for HDDs. 
- Since no moving parts in the SSD, it's
	more durable,
	run silently, 
	faster data access time, 
	better transfer rate
- Any address in SSD can be directly addressed compared to HDDS where block and cylinders should be pre-assigned.
- No restrictions on where data can be stored.
- With this direct access ability, data is less likely to be fragmented. No need for restructuring. 
- DRAM-Based SSDs also available addition to Flash memory. 
	DRAM-Based SSDs are more expensive, more faster and require internal power supply.
#### 3.1.5 Placing File Records on Disk
![[Pasted image 20250127162833.png]]
	Columns : Fields
	Rows : Records
	Each cell : value
	File : Sequence of records. (Usually all records in a file are in a same record type.)

- For a particular computer system, the number of bytes necessary for each data type is fixed.
	![[Pasted image 20250127163048.png]]
- Files can be in two types based on the types of records it contains,
	1. Fixed length records : All records in the file has the same size
	2. Variable length records : Different records of the file are of different sizes.
- Reason to have variable length records,
	Optional fields
	Some fields are of different sizes
	Some fields may have multiple values(Repeating group/filed)
	File includes different record type.(Mixed files)

- In a fixed length Record
	System can identify the ==starting byte location of each filed relative to the starting position of the record== since each record has equal fields and filed lengths.
	Variable length records can also be stored as fixed length records by
		1. Assigning "NULL" for optional fields.
		2. Assigning the maximum possible number of records for each repeating group. 
- In a variable length records,
	Each field in each record contains a value, but the precise length of some filed value is not correctly known. 
	To determine and terminate variable lengths special characters can be used. (Separators: `?`, `$`, `%`)
	They take up number of bytes for a particular record in each file. 

Ex: A fixed-length record with four fields and size of 44 bytes. 
**Entire record is fixed length, no record separator is required.** 
![[Pasted image 20250127172845.png]]

Ex: A record with two variable-length fields(Name and Department) and two fixed-length fields(NIC and Job_Code)
**Separator character is used to mark the record separation**.
![[Pasted image 20250127173057.png]]

Ex: A variable-field record with three types of separator characters. 
**The whole record is variable length. separators are required to mark the end of each filed as well the end of each record**.
![[Pasted image 20250127173428.png]]

#### Optimizations methods,
1. Record with optional fields,
**Problem** : In some records, all fields are not used and required. Storing empty or unused fields wastes space. 
**Solution** : Instead of storing all fields(including unused ones), you only store pairs of `<Field-Name, Filed-Value>`. A file is consist of series of these pairs. 

Ex: We have a records type for a user profile with following possible fields.
- Name, 
- Email, 
- Phone, 
- Middle Name(Optional)

Without optimization(Storing all fields),
```yaml
Name: John Doe
Email: john.doe@example.com
Phone: 1234567890
Middle Name: NULL
```
	Even thoug the middle is empty(NULL), it still occupies sotrage space. 
With optimization,
```yaml
Name: John Doe
Email: john.doe@example.com
Phone: 1234567890
```
	Fields are stored only when they have a value, reducing storage requirements.

Further optimization can be done by using **Field type codes** instead of including filed names in each and every record.(a predefined identifier for each field type)
The record will then store **<Field-Type, Field-Value>** pairs instead of the full field names, saving space.
Ex: 
- 1 = Name
- 2 = Email
- 3 = Phone
```yaml
01: John Doe
02: john.doe@example.com
03: 1234567890
04: 123 Main Street
```
	Field Type codes replace full field names for better efficiency.

2. Record with repeating fields
**Problem** : A record may include fields that have multiple values(repeating values, like a list of phone numbers). Without a clear structure, these values can be hard to interpret or process.
**Solution** : Use separator characters to organize repeated values.
- One separator to separate individual repeated values within the field.
- Another separator to mark the end of the field.
Ex: 
Without optimization,
```yaml
Order ID: 123
Products: Product1, Product2, Product3, Product4
```
	No clear structure to separate data.
With optimization,
```yaml
Order ID: 123
Products: Product1,Product2,Product3,Product4|
```
	Separator for individual values: `,` (comma)
	Separator to mark the field's end: `|` (pipe)

****
- **Block** is a unit data transfer between disk and memory.
When Block size > Record size,
	Several records may include in one block.
When Block size < Records size,
	One record can not fit into a single block.

- **Blocking Factor(bfr)** : Number of records(in bytes) can fit into a single disk block.
If Block size > Record size,
bfr can be calculated using, 
$$
\text{Blocking~Factor(bfr)} = \left\lfloor \frac{Block~Size}{Record~Size} \right\rfloor
$$
- It's floor function where round down the number to the nearest integer. 
There may be some additional space remaining in each block. 
$$
\text{Unused Space in bytes} = Block~Size - {bfr} \times{Record~Size}
$$
- To minimize the waste of storge, if a part of a record stored in one block and the other part stored in another block, and the next block is not the one holding the remainder of the record, 
	==a pointer at the end of the first block will be refers to the next block where the remainder is stored in.==

#### Unspanned and Spanned Organization of Records
- **Unspanned Organization of Records**
	Not allowing records to span into more than one block.
	Used with fixed length records.
	![[Pasted image 20250127203622.png]]
- **Spanned Organization of Records**
	One record spans to more than one block.
	Used when the Record Size > Block size.
	![[Pasted image 20250127203606.png]]

- In spanned organization, each block may store a different number of records. BFR would be the average number of records in a one block.
- We can calculate the **number of block needed to store a file with r number of records,**
$$
\text{Number~of~blocks(b)} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{Number of records in the file(r)}}{bfr} \right\rceil
$$
Ex: 
	There's a disk with block size(b) = 256bytes.
	A file has 50,000 fixed-length records(r).
	Each record has the following fields, 
	- NAME(55 bytes)
	- STDID(4 bytes)
	- DEGREE(2 bytes)
	- PHONE(10 bytes)
	- SEX(1 byte)
1. Record size = $(55 + 4 + 2 + 10 + 1) = 72~bytes$
2. Blocking factor
	$= \left\lfloor \frac{Block~Size}{Record~Size} \right\rfloor$
	$= \left\lfloor \frac{256~bytes}{72~bytes} \right\rfloor$
	$\text{3 records per block}$
3. Number of blocks required to store STUDENT records assuming an unspanned organization
	$= \left\lceil \frac{\text{Number of records in the file(r)}}{bfr} \right\rceil$
	$= \left\lceil \frac{\text{50,000}}{3} \right\rceil$
	$= 16667$

****
- **File Header/File Descriptor** : Includes information about a file that is required by the system applications.
- For fixed-length unspanned records, These header files contains information 
	to determine the disk addresses of the blocks, 
	record format descriptions which may include field length and the order of fields within a record,
	field type codes, 
	separator characters, 
- For Variable-length records, headers may include record type codes. 

****
#### 3.1.6 File Operations
- Types of file operations,
	![[Pasted image 20250127230020.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250127230128.png]]
1. Simple Selection Conditions
	Records where `Emp_No` = '0005'
2. Complex Selection Conditions
	Records where `Salary` > 60,000

- When several file records meet a search criterion, the first record in the sequence of file records is identified and assigned as the **Current Record**.
	Following search operations will start with this record and find the next record in the file that meets the criterion. 
- File access operations, 
![[Pasted image 20250127230726.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250127231351.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250127231438.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250127231516.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250127231847.png]]

- **File Organization** : The way a files data is organized into records, blocks, and access structures, including how records and blocks are put on the storage media and interconnected.
- **Access Methods** : A set of operations that may be applied to a file. 
- **Static files** : The files on which modifications are rarely done. 
- **Dynamic Files** : The files on which modifications are frequently done. 
- **Read only Files** : A file where modification cannot be done by the end user. 

#### 3.1.7 Files of unordered records(Heap files) and Ordered records(Sorted Files)
##### Files of Unordered Records(Heap Files)
- Records are entered into the file in the order in which they are received. New records are placed at the end

- Steps of inserting a new record,
	1. The file's last disk block transfers to a buffer, 
	2. Disk block gets update with the newly inserted record,
	3. Block overwritten back to the disk. 
	4. Final blocks address gets saved in the file header

- Searching in done by **Linear Search**.
	Blocks must be scanned sequentially. 
	On average, it will search half of the total block(b/2) before finding the desired record. 
	If the search criteria don't match to any records, the program must scan all b blocks to confirm that no matching record exist. 

- Deleting a record,
	1. Locate it's block.
	2. Copy the block into a buffer.
	3. Remove the records from the buffer.
	4. Rewrite the block back to the disk. 
- This method of deleting a record is results waste of storage space.
- **Deletion Marker** : A flag or identifier used to indicate that a records has been deleted, without physically removing the record from the disk immediately. 
	Deletion marker is a placeholder or a special value(a bit or a status filed) stored alongside a record to signify that the record is logically deleted. 
	The actual data remains in its block, but it is considered invalid for any future operations like searches or updates.
	Using a deletion marker avoids immediate disk I/O overhead.

- Modifying a record,
	Since updated record may not fit in its former space on the disk, modifying a variable-length record may require removing the old record and inserting the modified record. 

- Reading  record.
	a sorted copy of the file is produced to read all entries in order of the values of some field. 
	Because sorting a huge disk files is costly, specific approached for external sorting are employed. 

##### Files of Ordered Records(Sorted Files)
- One of a field in records called **Ordering Field** and it's used to physically order the data on disk. This is how ordered/sequential files are generated. 
- Benefits, 
	1. No sorting is required on the fly. 
	2. Highly efficient reading. 
	3. Next item is in the same block a the current one. No need of extra block visits. 
	4. Able to apply algorithms like binary search for quicker access.

****
#### 3.1.8 Hashing technique for storing database records
- Hashing can be used for another primary file structure to gain extremely quick access to information. 
- This approach requires a field called **Hash Field** in each record and it will be used for search conditions. 
- **Concept** : Hashing function(or randomizing function) applies to the hash field's value and return the address of the disk block where the record is stored. 

##### Internal Hashing
AKA **in-memory hashing**, refers to a technique where the entire dataset is stored in the computer's main memory (RAM). It uses a hash table to quickly map keys to their corresponding records.

1. **Method 1** (==**Division Hashing** or **Modular Hashing**==)
> [!NOTE] Important
> Types of key supported : Numerical keys only
> Hash function = h(K) Mod m

Internal hashing is a method used for string database records efficiently using a hash table. It stores records in **a hash table**, where an **array of slots (buckets)** is used to store data.
Each record is **mapped to a slot** using a **hash function**.
![[Pasted image 20250128120039.png]]
Steps,
1. Define a array of slots.
	Assume we have an array of size `m`, where the index range is `from 0 to m-1.`
	Number of available slots : m
2. Choose a hash function
	The function converts a key value `K` into an integer between 0 and m-1.
3. Compute the records address
	- `h(K)` : Hash function of K value. (The computed index/bucket)
	- `K` : the field value(ex: primary key)
	- `m` : total number of slots
$$
h(K) = K ~ Mod ~ m
$$
Ex: m = 10(array indices from 0 to 9) and we want to store a record with K=45.
	h(45) = 45 mod 10 = 5
	The record is stored at index 5 in the array.
	We can access the index 5 to retrieve that particular record.
![[Pasted image 20250128121027.png]]

2. **Method 2** (==**Multiplicative Hashing** or **Polynomial Rolling Hashing**==)
> [!NOTE] Important
> Types of key supported : String keys(or any sequence of character
> Hash function = Uses ASCII values and multiplies iteratively.

A variation of modular hashing designed specifically for handling **string keys** efficiently.
In this method, we use a hashing algorithm that applies a mod hash function to a character string(K) to process each character of K using iterative computation, instead of directly using `K Mod m`.

Hashing algorithm
```
temp = 1;
for i from 1 to 20 do {
	temp = temp * code(K[i]) Mod m;
}
hash_address = temp Mod m;
```

Steps,
1. Initialize a temporary variable
	`temp = 1`
2. Process each character of the key(K)
```
for i from 1 to 20 do {
	temp = temp * ASCIIcode(K[i]) Mod m;
}
```
- The algorithm iterates over the first 20 character of K(if K has fewer character than 20, the loop runs only for the available length)
- `ASCIIcode(K[i])` represent the ASCII value of the `i`-th character in K.
- The `temp` variable is continuously **multiplied** by the encoded value of `K[i]`, with the result being taken **mod `M`** to prevent overflow.
3. Compute the Final hash address
	`temp` value is again taken **mod `M`** to compute the **final bucket address** where the record will be stored.
	`hash_address = temp Mod m;`

Ex: Key(K) : "HELLO", m=11

| Character | ASCII code | Calculation `(temp = temp * code(K[i]) mod M)` |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| H         | 72         | `temp = (1 * 72) mod 11 = 6`                   |
| E         | 69         | `temp = (6 * 69) mod 11 = 9`                   |
| L         | 76         | `temp = (9 * 76) mod 11 = 3`                   |
| L         | 76         | `temp = (3 * 76) mod 11 = 9`                   |
| O         | 79         | `temp = (9 * 79) mod 11 = 7`                   |
Final hash
	`hash_address = 7 mod 11 = 7`

Advantages : 
	Better distribution, reduce clustering.
	Handles string keys.
When to use:
when keys are string or alphanumeric(ex: email)

3. **Method 3** (==**Folding Hashing**==)
This technique used to compute a hash address by breaking the key into smaller parts and applying mathematical or logical operations(such as addition or XOR) to generate the final hash value.

Steps,
1. Split the key into smaller parts
	The key(usually a large number or string) is divided into equal-sized segments.
2. Apply and operation on the parts
	Each segment is processed using an arithmetic or logical operation.
3. Compute the final hash value
	The results from the previous step are combined and then mapped to the hash table using modulus division(Mod m)

Ex: Suppose a 9-digit key: `987654321`
Split into three parts
- 987
- 654
- 321
Then sum up these parts : 987+654+321 = 1962
If our hash table has 100 slots(m)
	1962 mod 1000 = 962

Advantages:
	Works for both numeric and string keys.
	Reduce clustering and collision.
	Distribute hash values more evenly in the table. 
When to use
	When dealing with large keys(IDs)
	When more uniform is needed to avoid clustering.
	when simple modular hashing causes too many collision.

- **Collision** : Occurs when two different keys produce the same hash value.
	Ex:
	25 mod 10 = 5
	35 mod 10 = 5
- **Collision Resolution** : The process of finding another location. 
There are several method,
1. Open Addressing
	When collision occurs, it searches for another available slot. 
	Ex: 
	h(K), h(K) + 1, h(K) + 2, ...
2. Chaining
	Each slot of the hash table stores a linked list of elements that hash to the same value. 
	When collision occurs, all the subsequent elements will be chained to the linked list. 
3. Multiple Hashing/rehashing
	If the first hash function fails, a second hash function will be used. If a new collision occurs, the program will utilize open addressing or a third hash function.
	Or we can rehash all elements to reduce the collision. 
****
##### External Hashing
AKA **disk-based hashing**.
Used when the dataset is too large to fit in memory and must be stored on external storage.
It organizes data in a way that reduces the need for multiple disk accesses when searching, inserting, or deleting records.

- **Buckets/Pages** : Data is divided into fixed size buckets(or pages), and each bucket hold records with the similar hash values. The hash function maps keys to specific buckets.
	Bucket is a continuous group of disk blocks or a single disk block.

	B : Bucket numbers
- Efficient Disk Access : Most operations (such as searching or inserting a record) can be performed by reading only a few buckets from the disk. The entire database file doesn't required to be accessed but a part(bucket) of it.

- **Collision** : Since a single bucket hold several records, collision is less problematic. 
- **Overflow Handling** : When bucket overflows, the system may use an overflow area on the disk or it may rehash the data into new buckets for better distribution. 
	Or a chaining method can be applied in a way that pointers to overflowed records in each bucket is stored in the relevant bucket.
