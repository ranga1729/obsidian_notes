- Constraint is a conditions that specifies restriction on the database state. 
- Constraints maintain data integrity of a database. (Values are accurate and valid)
- Constrain categories, 
	1. Implicit : Constraints inherent from the Data model
		Ex: no duplicate tuples allowed, values should be atomic
	2. Explicit : Constraints apply in the Schema.(Using DDL)
	3. Business rules : 
		Applied through application programs or triggers. 
		Ex: employee salary should not exceed the supervisor salary 
#### Implicit
- Atomic values means these data are not divisible into components. 
- **Flat relational data model** doesn't represent composite/multivalued attributes. (Based on the 1NF)
- Multivalued attributes should be represented by separate relations. 
#### Explicit
- Applied in the schema using DDL.
- Types,
	1. Domain constraint
	2. Key constraint
	3. Null constraint
	4. Entity integrity constraint
	5. Referential integrity constraint

*****
##### 1. Domain constraint
- Ensure the data values match to the pre-defined data types of that column.
- Data types: Integers, Real numbers, Characters, Booleans, Fixed-length strings, Variable-length strings, Data, Time...
![[Pasted image 20250118110040.png]]
- Domain constraint can be set by several other constraints,
	1. CHECK constraint
	2. UNIQUE constraint
	3. DEFAULT constraint
- **CHECK constraint** : Set a subrange of value for the domain.
	![[Pasted image 20250118110220.png]]
- **UNIQUE constraint** : Enforce a column to have unique values. PRIMARY KEY default maintain unique constraint within it. 
	![[Pasted image 20250118110548.png]]
- **DEFAULT constraint** : Set a default value for the column. 
	![[Pasted image 20250118110658.png]]

##### 2. Key constraint
- No two tuples should have the same combination of attribute values.
- Helps to identify a tuple uniquely. 
	![[Pasted image 20250118111112.png]]
- Types of keys,
	1. Super key : 
		Any set of attributes can be used to identify a tuple uniquely. May contain extra attributes that aren't necessary for uniqueness. 
		Nullable. 
	2. Candidate key(minimal super key) : 
		Minimal set of attributes can be used to identify a tuple uniquely. 
		Removing any attributes would break the uniqueness.
		A table can have one or more candidate keys.
		Not nullable.
	3. Primary key
		A candidate key chosen by the DB designer.
		A table can have only one primary key.
		Not nullable.
		Enforces entity integrity in the DB.
	4. Composite key
		A primary key (or a candidate key) consist of two or more attributes. 
		Used when a single attribute is insufficient to ensure uniqueness. 
		Not nullable.
- When declaring a composite primary key, it has to be defined separately after declaring the attributes. 
	![[Pasted image 20250118112539.png]]
##### 3. Entity Integrity constraint
- Meaning: No primary key values can be null. 

##### 4. NOT NULL constraint
- Make sure that columns which has applied this constraint does not hold NULL values. 
	![[Pasted image 20250118113221.png]]
- An attribute with with **UNIQUE** and **NOT NULL** constraints can be take as a candidate key.
##### 5. Referential Integrity constraint
- Refer to the Foreign key.
- Referencing Table : Table which foreign key is applied. 
- Referenced Table : The table that referenced by the foreign key.
- The primary key that is referenced by the foreign key must be pre-defined int he referenced table.
- Allows consistency of value across related tables. 
- Foreign key should be in the same domain as the primary key.
- Foreign key doesn't allowed to have NULL values.

*****
#### Specifying names to constraints
Databases allows to create names for constraints.(Optional)
```sql
CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> <constraint_type>
```
![[Pasted image 20250118114417.png]]
- Purpose, 
	1. Easier identification
	2. Better maintenance
	3. Improved readability
	4. Portability
	5. Best practice and standards
![[Pasted image 20250118114324.png]]
- If we want to remove this primary key,
```sql
ALTER TABLE STUDENT DROP CONSTRAINT PK_STDID;
```
- When showing error messages the system will report the name `PK_STDID` instead of generic names like `SYS_C001`. Some DBS generate default names for constraints. Explicitly naming them leads to maintain a consistent convention across the environment. 

*****
#### Referential Constraint Actions
Define alternate processing options for the referencing table in the event a referenced row is deleted or updated when there are existing matching rows.
- Types of events,
	1. ON UPDATE : Execute when update occurs in the Referenced(Primary key) table.
	2. ON DELETE : Execute when delete occurs in the Referenced(Primary key) table.
	3. or both can be mentioned
- Types of actions,
	1. CASCADE : Primary key change will be replicate to the foreign key.
	2. SET NULL : Set NULL for the corresponding foreign key of the changed primary key.
	3. SET DEFAULT : Set the given DEFAULT value for the corresponding  foreign key of the changed primary key.
	4. RESTRICT(Default behaviour) : Doesn't allow the change to apply on the primary key if there's a matching foreign key. An error will be shown.
```sql
ON UPDATE {CASCADE | SET NULL | RESTRICT(or NO ACTION)}
--OR
ON DELETE {CASCADE | SET NULL | RESTRICT(or NO ACTION)}
```
![[Pasted image 20250118121416.png]]

*****
- Constraints that can get violated while performing an INSERT,
	1. Entity Integrity violation
		Insert NULL for the primary key
	2. Key constraint violation
		Insert an existing primary key
	3. Referential integrity violation
		Insert a tuple for the foreign key which doesn't reference a primary key in the corresponding table. 
	4. Domain constraint violation
		Insert inappropriate data type. 
- If an INSERT violates a constrain, it will get rejected.

- DELETE can violate the Referential integrity.
- This can be handled by using Referential Constraint Actions.

- Constraints that can get violated while performing an UPDATE,
	1. Domain constraint
		inappropriate data type
	2. Primary key violation
		Adding an existing value
	3. Referential integrity violation
		Update the primary key value of a tuple without updating that value in a referencing table. 
****
#### DROP Table
- Delete the entire table with data. 
- Types of actions can be taken when deleting the table,
	1. RESTRICT : If there are FK constraints or views, delete will not be happen. 
	2. CASCADE : Drop all other constraints & views that refer the table.
```sql
DROP TABLE Employee [RESTRICT|CASCADE]
```

****
#### ADD or REMOVE Constraints
- Drop the Primary key
```mysql
ALTER TABLE Employees
DROP CONSTRAINT PK_Employee;

--OR--

ALTER TABLE Student DROP PRIMARY KEY;
```
- Drop a unique, foreign key or check constraint
```mysql
ALTER TABLE Employee
DROP CONSTRAINT FK_EmpDept;
```
- Add a new constraint
```mysql
ALTER TABLE PassStudent
ADD CONSTRAINT avg_Marks CHECK(marks >= 50);
```

****
#### Other types of Constraints
- Above constraints can be applied through DDL.
- Other semantic integrity constraints/business rules should be applied using a application program.
- We can use **Trigger** and **Assertions** in SQL. 

#### Assertions
- Assertions are a type of constraints that enforces a condition or rule across multiple table or rows to maintain the integrity of the database.
- This condition must always hold true for the database. 
- If any operation(INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE) violates it, the operation will be rejected.
- Syntax,
```mysql
CREATE ASSERTION assertion_name CHECK (condition);
```

Ex: Ensure that the total salary of all employees in a department does not exceed $1,000,000.
```mysql
CREATE ASSERTION TotalSalaryLimit
CHECK (
    (SELECT SUM(Salary)
     FROM Employee
     GROUP BY DepartmentID) <= 1000000
);
```
Ex: Ensure that the total quantity of products in the `Inventory` table is always above 100.
```mysql
CREATE ASSERTION MinimumStock
CHECK (
    (SELECT SUM(Quantity) FROM Inventory) > 100
);
```
Ex: No employee should have a salary greater than their manager
```mysql
CREATE ASSERTION SALARY_CONSTRAINT 
CHECK ( 
	NOT EXISTS ( SELECT * Constraint Name FROM EMPLOYEE E, EMPLOYEE M, DEPARTMENT D WHERE E.Salary>M.Salary AND E.Dno = D.Dnumber AND D.Mgr_ssn = M.Ssn 
	) 
);
```

- Assertions apply to multiple tables, rows while other constraints(CHECK) are limited to single table. 

*****
#### Active Databases
- An **active database** is a type of database system that can automatically respond to certain events or changes in the database without user intervention. It uses rules or triggers to monitor and react to specific conditions, making it more dynamic compared to traditional passive databases, which require external actions (like queries or scripts) to perform operations.
- **ECA(Event-Condition-Action)** model is a framework used to create rules in active DB. 
- Active rules maintain derived data when values of tuples change.
- **Tiggers** are used to define automatic actions that need to be executed when events happen.

****
#### Triggers
- Tigger is a statement that get executes automatically as a side effect when database get modified and a certain conditions get satisfied.
- Follow ECA framework to create triggers,
	1. Event : a cause to check
		Ex: insertion of new rows
	2. Condition : logic to be satisfied
		is salary < 1000
	3. Action : the action get executes
- Types of triggers,
	1. Row triggers
		Fires for each row in a transaction.
		Ex: if UPDATE statement affects 10 rows, 10 rows triggers will be fired, one for each row.
		Have access to `:new`(new value) and `:old`(old value).
	1. Statement triggers
		Fires for each transaction. 
		Ex: if UPDATE statement affects 10 rows, only 1 statement trigger will be fired.
	2. Before triggers
		Runs before any change is made to the database. 
		Ex: Before withdrawing money, account balance is required to be checked.
	3. After triggers
		Runs after changes are made to the database.
		Ex: After withdrawing money, update the account balance.
	4. Instead of triggers
		Used to modify views that can not be modified through UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE statements. 
![[Pasted image 20250118151645.png]]
Ex: 
```mysql
CREATE TRIGGER GPA_Alert
AFTER UPDATE ON Student
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (NEW.GPA < 2.0)
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO WarningLog (StudentID, Message)
    VALUES (NEW.StudentID, 'Your GPA has dropped below 2.0. Please consult your advisor.');
END;
```
Ex: When inserting values for the Employee table ensure whether the salary is >= 20000.
`Employee(Empid, Ename, Salary, Dno)`
```mysql
CREATE TRIGGER check_salary 
	BEFORE INSERT ON Employee 
	FOR EACH ROW 
		BEGIN 
			IF (:new.Salary < 20000) 
			THEN 
				PRINT ‘Wrong Salary’; 
		END IF; 
END;
```

- `OLD` and `NEW` references are not available for table-level triggers and it can be used for record-level(for each row) triggers. 
Ex: updating total salary (delete old salary and add new salary of employees) of a particular department.
