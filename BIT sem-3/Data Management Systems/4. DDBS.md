- **Distributed Computing System** : A system that performs certain assigned tasks with the help of several sites which are connected via a computer network
- **Distributed Database System** : A set of logically interrelated databases connected via a computer network.
- Minimum condition to form a distributed database,
	1. Multiple computers(nodes)
	2. Logical relationship between information available in different nodes.
	3. Hardware, software, data should not mandatory to be identical.
- Network topology directly affects the performance and query processing of the DDB.
- **Transparency** : Not allowing the end user to know implementation details. 
- Types of transparency,
	1. **Location transparency** 
		Commands issued are not based on the location of the data or the node. 
	2. **Naming transparency**
		An object should be accessible by it's name without giving additional details. 
	3. **Replication transparency**
		User is not aware about the replicas available in each node. 
	4. **Fragmentation transparency**
		User is not aware of the fragments available. 
	5. **Design transparency**
		User is unaware of the design of the distributed database.
	6. **Execution transparency**
		User is unaware of the transaction execution details. 
- **Reliability** : Probability of a system is running at any given time.
- **Availability** : Probability of a system been continuously available at any given time.
- **Failure** : System deviates from it's defined behavior.
- **Errors** : A subset of states which causes the failures.
- **Fault** : A cause of an error.

- Methods to make a system reliable,
	1. **Fault tolerance** : Identify and eliminate faults before they result in system failures.
	2. Conducting quality control measures and testing.
- A reliable DDBMS should be able to process user requests as long as database consistency is preserved.

- **Scalability** : Ability to expand the system without making a disturbance to the operations.
- Types of scalability
	1. **Horizontal Scalability**
		Expand the number of nodes in the system.
		(Distribute data and processing load among new nodes.)
	2. **Vertical Scalability**
		Expand the capacity of already existing nodes/system.
		(ex: expand the storage, processing power)
- When the number of node are increased(horizonal scaling), the possibility of network failures also grow up. 
	Network failure can make nodes to be partitioned into subgroups. 
	Nodes within the same subgroup(subnetwork) can communicate each other while communication between partitions are lost. 
 - **Partition tolerance** : The ability of the system to keep operating even though the network is divided into separate groups.

-  **Autonomy** : The extent a single node can work independently.
- Aspects of autonomy,
	1. **Design autonomy**
		Independence of data model and transaction management techniques.
	2. **Communication autonomy**
		Flexibility to share information with each other nodes. 
	3. **Execution autonomy**
		Independence of users to operate as they prefer. 

- Advantages of DDBs,
	1. Ability to carry out development and maintenance from different locations.
	2. Faults can be isolated to the site of origin without affecting the whole system. (fault tolerance & improved availability - even though a single node fails, the other nodes continue to operate without failing the entire system)
	3. Requests can be data traffic can be distributed throughout the system.
	4. Allows parallel execution of multiple queries at the same time on different sites.
	5. Horizontal growth.

*****
- DDB classification based on homogeneity,
	1. **Homogenous system**
		All the servers in the DDB use identical software and all the clients use the identical software.
	2. **Heterogeneous system**
		Different software installed on the servers or users involved with the DDB using different software.

- **Local autonomy** : Allowing local site(server) to be operated as an independent site. 
- Classification of DDBMS based on the distribution, autonomy and heterogeneity, 
	1. **Centralized BD** : 
		100% autonomy.
		0% distribution.
	2. **Pure distributed database systems**
		0% local autonomy
		100% distribution
	3. **Federated Databases**
		Distributed database system that consists of a collection of independent, possibly heterogeneous, databases that are loosely coupled. These databases are integrated and can work together while retaining their autonomy.
	4. **Multi-databases Systems**
		distributed database system where multiple databases, typically located in different systems or locations, are interconnected to form a larger system. The databases in an MDBS are usually heterogeneous, meaning they can be of different types or use different DBMSs. However, the emphasis is on enabling data sharing and access across these different databases.

*****
- **Fragmentation** : Divide the whole database into various sub-relations to distribute through different nodes.
- Methods of fragmentation
	1. **Horizontal fragmentation**
	2. **Vertical fragmentation**
	3. **Mixed fragmentation**
##### 1. Horizontal Fragmentation (Sharding)
- Divide the database into subsets of rows. AKA **Shards**.
- Dividing based on a condition and subsets has a logical relation. 
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20250131221934.png]]
- Original Database can be reconstruct by taking the union of all fragments.
- Each horizontal fragment on a relation R can be specified in the relational algebra by
$$
\alpha_{Ci}(R)
$$
	Ci : Condition
	R : Relation name
Ex: Original table (Employee) is divided into two shards.
1. `Sales_employee` fragment consist of details of employees who are working in the sales department. 
$$
\text{Sales\_employee} = \alpha_{Department~=~''Sales''}~(Employee)
$$
2. `Marketing_employee` fragment consist of details of employees who are working in the marketing department. 
$$
\text{Marketing\_employee} = \alpha_{Department~=~''Marketing''}~(Employee)
$$
##### 2. Vertical Fragmentation
- Divide table by columns.
- Can be used in a situation where we don't require to store all attributes all at one place. 
- It's essential to include the primary key or some unique key attribute in every vertical fragment.
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20250131224221.png]]

- Each vertical fragment on a relation R can be specified in the relational algebra by
$$
\pi_{Ai}(R)
$$
	Ai : Attributes
	R : Relation name
Ex:
Original table(Employee) is divided into two subsets of columns. 
1. `Pay_data` fragment consist of salary details of employees
$$
\text{Pay\_data} = \pi_{~name, ~salary}~(Employee)
$$
2. `Dept_data` fragment consist of department details of employees
$$
\text{Pay\_data} = \pi_{~name, ~department}~(Employee)
$$
##### 3. Mixed Fragmentation(Hybrid)
- A combination of both the horizontal and vertical fragmentations. 
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20250201002453.png]]

*****
- Purpose of Replication : Having data replicated in several nodes to ensure the availability of data. 
- Extremes of replications,
	1. **Full replication**
		Entire database copy reside in all nodes.
		Achieve a higher availability.
		Improved read performance(any node can address read queries).
		Degraded write performance(every node must get the write query). 
		Concurrency control and recovery techniques become expensive.
	2. **No replication**
		Every data item is stored only at one node.
		AKA 'non-redundant allocation.'
		Improved write performances.(Only one node get the write query)
		Less availability.
- All the replicas should be synchronized when an update is taken place.

- **Allocation** : Process of distributing data into nodes. 
- Consideration for selecting the node to hold each fragment and number of replicas,
	1. performance requirement
	2. types of transactions
	3. Availability goals
	4. Transaction frequency
Ex: 
- Requires high availability with high number of retrievals : full replications
- Requires a subsection of data frequently : Allocate required fragment into multiple nodes
- Requires higher number of updates : Recommended Less number of replicas

*****
- Distribution models,
	1. **Single server**
		The database will be run on a single server. 
		Reduced complexity. 
	2. **Sharding**
		![[Pasted image 20250201014050.png]]
		Splitting data into several parts and storing them in different nodes. 
		Helps load balancing.
		Essential to segregate data and data that are accessed together should be stored in a single node. 
		Auto-sharding can be enabled in some NOSQL DBs.
		Sharding will improve read performances.
		Improvements,
		- Replication and Caching
		- horizontal scaling
	3. **Master-slave replication**
		![[Pasted image 20250201014116.png]]
		One node is selected as **Master(Primary)** and it's the authorized source for data.
		Master responsible for update.
		Other nodes are **Slaves(Secondary)**
		Synchronization process runs to sync data inside master with slaves.
		Suitable for read-intensive datasets. 
		Read operation efficiency improves by adding more slaves. 
		Only master can writes to the DB.
		If the master fails, a slave can be appointed as the new master.
	4. **Peer-to-peer replications**
		![[Pasted image 20250201014718.png]]
		All the nodes are equal.
		All replicas can accept writes. 
		Inconsistencies can be happen. (After writing on a node, two users accessing that changed data item from different nodes may read two different values until data propagation is completed)
- Combining master-slave and sharding
	Multiple masters can be appointed for each data item.
- Combining peer-to-peer and sharding
	Common in column-family databases.

- Steps of distributed query processing,
	1. **Query mapping**
	2. **Localization**
	3. **Global query optimization**
	4. **Local Query Optimization**

1. **Query Mapping** (performed at a central control node)
	Query written in query language translates into an algebraic query.
	The translation process is referred to global conceptual schema.
	(Translation doesn't consider the replicas and shards)
	Algebraic query is then normalized and analyzed for semantic errors.
2. **Localization** (performed at a central control node)
	Distributed query is mapped to separate queries on fragments where the data resides. 
	Data distribution and fragmentation details are used. 
3. **Global Query Optimization**
	Creating an optimal execution plan for the entire query, considering the entire distributed system. 
	The global optimizer consider,
		overall cost of executing the query,
		communication,
		data transfer and 
		computation cost at various nodes. 
	Costs can include factors such as data transfer times, CPU time, and disk I/O.
4. **Local Query Optimization** (performed locally at each site)
	Focuses on optimizing the execution of each subquery at the individual node level.

Example: Results are expected to be presented in node 03.
![[Pasted image 20250201103208.png]]
1. Calculate the size of each relation
Number of records in Employee relation = 10,000
Size of a one record = 100 bytes
Size of the Employee relation = 1,000,000 bytes

Number of records in Department relation = 100
Size of a one record = 35 bytes
Size of the Employee relation = 3,500 bytes

![[Pasted image 20250201103511.png]]
	Assume EMPLOYEE table has column called `Dnumber`.

2. Assume we want to query first name, last name and department name for each employee. Write the query in relational algebra.
$Q : \Pi_{Fname, Lname, Dname}(EMPLOYEE \bowtie_{Dno=Dnumber}DEPARTMENT)$

We have 3 strategies to execute this query,
**Method 1**
Transfer data in the EMPLOYEE relation and the DEPARTMENT relation into the result site (node 03). Then perform the join operation at node 3.
Total number of bytes to be transferred 
	= Size of the Employee + Size of the Department
	= 1,000,000 + 3,500
	= 1,003,500 bytes

**Method 2**
Transfer the EMPLOYEE relation to site 2. Execute the join at site 2. Send the result to site 3.
Size of a result record 
	= `Fname` + `LName` + `Dname`
	= 15 + 15 + 10 bytes
	= 40 bytes
Total number of bytes to be transferred 
	= Size of the Employee + Size of the query result
	= 1,000,000 + (40 * 10,000)
	= 1,400,000 bytes

**Method 3**
Transfer the DEPARTMENT relation to site 1. Execute the join at site 1. Send the result to site 3.
Size of a result record 
	= `Fname` + `LName` + `Dname`
	= 15 + 15 + 10 bytes
	= 40 bytes
Total number of bytes to be transferred 
	= Size of the Department + Size of the query result
	= 3,500 + (40 * 10,000)
	= 403,500 bytes

**Method 3 is the optimal solution, since it transfers the minimum amount of data.**

****
#### NOSQL characteristics in DDBD
1. **Scalability** : Potential of a system to handle a growing amount of data.
	Two strategies for scaling a system,
	1. **Horizontal scalability**
		When the amount of data increases, distributed system can be expanded by adding more nodes into the system.
	2. **Vertical scalability**
		Increasing the storage capacity of existing nodes.
	It is possible to carry out horizontal scalability while the system is on operation. We can distribute the data among newly added sites without disturbing the operations of system.

2. **Availability, Replication and Eventual Consistency**
	Availability is achieved by replicating data across nodes. 
	Read performance increases due to replication.
	Replication affects write performance. 
	NOSQL applications prefer **Eventual Consistency**.
	
> [!NOTE] Eventual Consistency
> At any time there may be nodes with replication inconsistencies, but if there are no further updates, eventually all the nodes will synchronize and will be updated to the same value.

3. **Replication Models**
	Ex: Master-Salve, Peer-to-Peer

4. **Sharding of files**
	Combination of sharding and replication improves load balancing and data availability.

5. **High performance data access**
	NOSQL DBs uses several techniques to achieve fast data access.
		1. Hashing
		2. Range Partitioning(Object’s location can be identified from range of key values)
		3. Indexing
