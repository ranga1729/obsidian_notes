- Functional models represent how the business system will behave. 
- Structural model represent the objects that are used and created by a business system. 
- Illustrates people, places or things that information is captured and how they are related to another. 
- The structural model is drawn using an iterative process. 
	First draw a conceptual model shows the logical organization of the objects, without any implementation or technical details. 
	Then evolve the conceptual structural model into a design model that reflects how the objects will be organized in database and software. 
- Structural models are shown using,
	1. CRC cards,
	2. Class diagrams
	3. Object diagrams
#### Need for relationships
- Object do not exist in isolation.
- System behaviour is achieved through the interactions of the objects in the system. 

Ex: When a member wants to borrow a book in a library system(borrowing use case), the system has to interact with the following objects, 
	book
	copy
	borrower
	borrowed copy
For the borrowing use-case following are some of the messages that these objects have to send and receive. 
	checkBorrowerId,
	checkCopyBorrowable,
	checkOverdue,
	checkOverlimit, ...etc
- When there is an object interaction, it indicates there is a relationship between the corresponding classes. 
- It allows one class to know about the attributes, operations of another class. 
#### Object identification
- Most common approaches to identify a set of candidate objects for the structural model,
	1. Textual analysis 
	2. Brainstorming
	3. Common object lists
	4. Patterns
##### 1. Textual Analysis
- Reviewing the use-case diagram and examining the use-case description to identify potential objects, attributes, operations and relationships.
- In the use case,
	**Nouns** suggest possible classes
	**Verbs** suggest possible operations
##### 2. Brainstorming
Individuals suggest potential classes.
Further discussion can identify potential attributes, operations and relationships for each of the identified objects. 
##### 3. Common Object Lists
Simply a list of objects common to the business domain of the system.
##### 4. Patterns
Simply a useful group of collaborating classes that provide a solution to a commonly occurring problem. 
We can look at the objects previously identified through textual analysis, brainstorming, and/or common object lists and see if it makes sense to map any of them into any predefined reusable patterns.

### CRC(Class-Responsibility-Collaboration)
Used to document the responsibilities and and collaborations of a class, form a bridge from structural model to behavioral model.
- Responsibilities : Knowing, Doing
- Collaboration : Objects working together to service a request

- CRC card template, (no standard)

- Elements of a CRC card,
	1. Name
	2. Responsibilities : left hand side
	3. Collaborators : which help to carry out each responsibility on the right-hand side of the card.

Role-Playing CRC Cards with use cases,
Once cards are filled out, the analyst can use the cards in role-playing. Each CRC card should be assigned to an individual who will perform the operation for the class on the CRC card.
Each CRC card should be assigned to an individual who will perform the operations for the class on the CRC card.

Steps of role-playing to create the class diagrams,
1. Create CRC cards
2. Review CRC cards
3. Role-play the CRC cards
4. Create class diagram
5. Review class diagram
6. Incorporate patterns
7. Review the model and validate it.

#### Creating structural model using CRC cards and class diagrams
- Creating a structural model is an incremental and iterative process. 
Steps,
1. Create CRC cards
2. Role-play the CRC cards
3. Create class diagram
4. Review class diagram
5. Review the model and validate it.

#### Validate the structural model
- Walkthrough with role-playing can be used. 
- Each class should be linked back to at least one use case. 
- Every CRC card should be associated with a class on the class diagram and vice versa. 
- Attributes listed on the back of the CRC card must be included as attributes in a class on a class diagram, and vice versa.
- The relationships included on the back of the CRC card must be portrayed using the appropriate notation on the class diagram.
- Verify and validate the functional model will ensure the consistency of the structural representations such as CRC cards and class diagrams.
