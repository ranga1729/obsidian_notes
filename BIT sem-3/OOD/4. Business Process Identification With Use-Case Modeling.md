- Created by **Dr. Ivan Jacobson** in 1968.
- Use-case represents the the way a business system interacts with it environment. 
- Object-Oriented systems are use case driven. 
- It models system functions in terms of,
	1. Business events
	2. Who initiated the events
	3. How the system responds to those events
- Use case provides a, 
	tool for capturing functional requirements
	tool for requirement traceability
	framework for driving the system development project

#### Creating a Use Case Diagram
- Steps, 
1. Review the requirements definition.
	Get a complete overview of the underlying business process.
2. Identify the subject's boundaries.
	Identify the scope of the system.
3. Identify the primary actors and their goals
	Goal represent the functionality that the system must provide to the actor.
4. Identify the business process and major use cases.
5. Review the current set of use cases. 
	It may necessary to split some of them into multiple use cases or merge some of them into a single use case. 

- Parts drawn on the use-case,
	1. System boundary
	2. Use cases
	3. actors
	4. associations between components

- Several execution paths that a user can take while interacting with the system are called **"Scenarios"**. 
- Scenarios are used in behavioral modeling. 

Ex: This is a complete scenario where customer purchase an item. Another scenario can be customer doesn't purchase an item. 
Scenario - Purchase items
	Customer review items in the shopping cart
	Customer provide payment details
	System validate payment information 
	System will send confirmation of order details to customer in an email.

- A user-case description or Use case narrative contains all the information needed to build the structural and behavioral diagrams that follow, but it express the information in a less-formal way that is usually for users to understand. 
#### Business process documentation with use cases and **use case description**
A **use-case description** is a detailed explanation of a specific way in which a system, application, or process interacts with users or other systems to achieve a specific goal. It outlines the steps, participants, and conditions involved in achieving that goal, providing a clear understanding of the functionality and purpose of the system.

Key components of a Use-case description,
- **Use-Case Name**: A clear and concise title that identifies the goal or feature (e.g., "Book Event Tickets").
- **Actors**: The users or systems involved in the interaction. These can include:
    - **Primary actors**: Users who initiate the interaction (e.g., "Student").
    - **Secondary actors**: Systems or other services that assist in the process (e.g., "Payment Gateway").
- **Preconditions**: Conditions or requirements that must be met before the use case can begin (e.g., "User must be logged in").
- **Trigger**: The event or action that initiates the use case (e.g., "User clicks the 'Buy Ticket' button").
- **Main Flow (or Basic Flow)**: The primary sequence of steps the actors and the system follow to achieve the goal (e.g., "User selects an event, chooses tickets, and completes payment").
- **Alternate Flows**: Variations or exceptions to the main flow, such as what happens if something goes wrong (e.g., "User cancels payment" or "System fails to verify the card").
- **Postconditions**: The state of the system after the use case has been executed successfully (e.g., "Ticket purchase is confirmed, and confirmation email is sent").
- **Assumptions**: Optional conditions assumed to be true but not explicitly stated (e.g., "User has a valid email address").

*****
1. Priority
	Importance of the use-case (high/medium/low)
2. Source
	Entity that triggers the creation of the use case.
3. Primary business actor
	Who benefits from the use case
4. Other participating actors
	Facilitating actors
5. Other interested stakeholders
6. Business requirement
	General understanding of problem domain and scope

We can expand the use case narrative with more details like,
	1. Preconditions
		Ex: Typically another use case that must be previously executed
	2. Triggers
		Ex: Receiving a cheque.
	3. Typical course of events
		Ex: Borrowing, checkMember, checkOverdue, checOverLimit, checkCopyBorrowable, confirmBorrowing
	4. Alternate courses
		Ex: Errors, Confirm messages
	5. Post conditions
		Ex: Receipt delivered to the customer

Example
#### Use-Case Name:
Buy Event Tickets
#### Actors:
- Primary Actor: Student
- Secondary Actor: Payment Gateway
#### Preconditions:
- The student must have an account on the website.
- The event must be available for booking.
#### Trigger:
- The student clicks the "Buy Tickets" button on an event page.
#### Main Flow:
1. Student logs into their account.
2. Student navigates to the event page.
3. Student clicks "Buy Tickets."
4. System displays ticket options.
5. Student selects a ticket type and quantity.
6. System calculates the total price and prompts for payment.
7. Student enters payment details and confirms the purchase.
8. Payment gateway processes the transaction.
9. System generates a ticket and sends a confirmation email to the student.
#### Alternate Flows:
- **Payment Failure**: If the payment fails, the system displays an error message and allows the student to retry.
- **Event Sold Out**: If tickets are no longer available, the system notifies the student and suggests alternative events.
#### Postconditions:
- The ticket purchase is recorded in the system.
- The student receives a confirmation email.
