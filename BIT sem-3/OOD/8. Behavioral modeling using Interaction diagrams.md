- Behavioral models describe internal dynamic aspects of an system. 
- Interactions diagrams are a graphical view of the scenarios associated with use cases.

Types of Interaction Diagrams,
- UML 1.X 
	1. Sequence Diagram
	2. Collaboration/Communication Diagram
- UML 2.0 introduces 2 more,
	1. Timing Diagram
	2. Interaction overview Diagrams

## 1. Sequence Diagram
Shows the , 
- Object interactions arranged in time sequence
- Object and classes involved in the scenario
- Sequence of messages exchanged between the objects
#### Boundary classes
- Boundary classes represent interactions with the user or another system.
- In the analysis phase, boundary classes are shown on a sequence diagrams to document requirements of interfaces. 
#### System Sequence Diagrams
- It's a tools used by analysts in logical phase.
- Helps to identify the high-level messages that enter and exit the system. 
	Later these messages will become the responsibility of individual objects. 
	These individual objects will full fill those responsibilities by communicating with other objects. 

- Sequence diagram should be kept as simple as possible.
- It should be easy to see,
	objects
	object interactions
	messages between objects
	the functionality captured by the scenario

##### Handle conditional logic in a sequence 
- If the logic is simple, involves only few messages
	Add the logic to one diagram and use notes to communicate the choices to be made. 
- If the logic is complex, involves complicated messages, 
	Draw separate diagrams.
	one for the if case,
	one for the then case
	one for the else case

- Most I-CASE tools allows diagrams to be linked to one another, allowing user to navigate through a set of diagrams. 
##### Activation Bar (Focus control)
![[Pasted image 20250124131045.png]]
- A small rectangle, that will let you know which object has control at a particular point of time. 
- Activation bar is only shown in the sequence diagram, not in communication diagrams. 
#### Interaction operators

*****
### Communication Diagram
- Similar to a sequence diagram.
- Show how the members of a set of objects collaborate to implement a use case-case scenario. 
- Communication diagrams are equivalent to sequence diagrams, but they emphasize  the flow of messages through a set of object, whereas the sequence diagrams focus on the time ordering of the messages being passed. 
##### Elements of a Communication Diagram

UML notation for objects, links and messages in a communication diagrams,
![[Pasted image 20250124182058.png]]

Ex: 
![[Pasted image 20250124182316.png]]
- A sequence diagram is read from top to bottom. So message numbering is not necessary.
- A communication diagram losses its sequencing information, so it's necessary to have message numbering.

****
Communication Diagram vs Sequence Diagram
- Sequence diagram
	Show a scenario in a time-based order.(orderly manner)
	Customers can easily read and understand.
	Useful in early analysis phases
- Communication diagram
	Tend to provide the big picture for a scenario.
	Organize around the object links to one another. Used more in the design phase of the development.
