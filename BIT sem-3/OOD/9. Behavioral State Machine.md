A behavioral state machine is a dynamic model that show the different states through which a single object passes during its life in response to events, along with its responses and actions. 
Ex: 
	a washing machine changes it state from washing to rinsing. 
	hotel room changes it's status to available, reserved and occupied. 
State diagrams captures these type changes. 


- State transition diagram shows,
	1. state changes of a given object.
	2. events/messages that causes a transition form one state to another. 
	3. the actions that results from a state change. 
- State diagrams are created only for classes with significant dynamic behavior. 
	Ex: hotel room in a hotel reservation system.
- Interaction diagrams can be studied to determine the dynamic objects.
	objects receives and send many messages. 

Guidelines for creating a state diagram,
1. Examine the class diagram to identify which classes undergo a complex series of state changes. 
2. Identify the various states that an object will have over its lifetime. 
3. Determine the sequence/order of the states that object pass through its lifetime. 
4. Identify the transitions between the states of the objects and add the events, actions and guard conditions associated with the transitions. 
5. Validate the behavioral state machine. 

Why state diagram important ?
- Models the changes of the objects. 
- Help analysts, designers and developers understand the behavior of the object in a system. 
- A class diagram and an object diagram show only static aspect of a system. They do not show the dynamic details of the behaviors.  
- Help developers to understand how the objects are suppose to behave.

### CRUDE Analysis
A technique to identify how the underlying objects work together.

| Letter | Meaning        |
| ------ | -------------- |
| C      | Create         |
| R      | Read/Reference |
| U      | Update         |
| D      | Delete         |
| E      | Execute        |
Uses a CRUDE matrix,
Ex: Make patient appointment use case in medical care system.

- The more (C)create, (U)update, (D)delete entries in the column associated with a class, the more likely the instance of the class have a complex life cycle. So these objects are candidates for state modeling with behavioral state machine. 
#### Verifying and Validating the Behavioral Model
- Sequence and communication diagrams models the interaction among instances of classes that work together to support the business included in a system. 
- The behavioral state machine describes the changes through which an object traverses during its lifetime. 
- The CRUDE matrix represent a system level overview of the interactions among the objects in the system. 

1. Every actor and object included on a sequence diagram must be included as as actor and an object on a communication diagram and vice versa.
2. Every message in the sequence diagrams must appear as a message on an association in the corresponding communication diagram. and vice versa. 
3. The sequence number included as part of a message label in a communications diagram implies the sequential order in which the message will be sent. Therefore, it must correspond to the top-down ordering of the messages being sent on the sequence diagram.
4. All transitions contained in a behavior state machine must be associated with a message being sent on a sequence and communication diagram, and it must be classified as a (C)reate, (U)pdate, or (D)elete message in a CRUDE matrix. 
5. All entries in a CRUDE matrix imply a message being sent from an actor or object to another actor or object. If the entry is a (C)reate, (U)pdate, or (D)elete, then there must be an associated transition in a behavioral state machine that represents the instances of the receiving class.

### Component Diagram
- Used to visualize physical components in a system.
	Ex: Libraries, packages, files
- Component diagram also a static view of a system. 
- Mainly contains,
	Components,
	Interfaces,
	Relationships
- Components are related via dependency relationships. 
Ex:

UML 2.0 adds additional notations,
Ex: Order System

### Deployment Diagram
- Shows the physical architecture of a computer-based system.
- It shows,
	computers and devices
	connections with one another, 
	software that sits on each machine
- It maps the software architecture to the hardware architecture. 

- Used only for distributed systems.
- The main hardware item is a node, a generic names for nay kind of computing recourse.

### New diagrams introduced in UML 2.0
1. Composite structure diagram
	Show classes internal structure. 
	Ex: 
	![[Pasted image 20250124222625.png]]
2. Interaction Overview Diagram
	Expands the activity diagram
	Ex: Got to the library and borrow a book.
	![[Pasted image 20250124222850.png]]
3. Timing Diagram
	Show how long an object is on a state. 
	Sequence diagram doesn't show the duration explicitly.
