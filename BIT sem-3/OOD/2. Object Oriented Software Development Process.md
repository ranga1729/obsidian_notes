### Introduction to Object Oriented System Analysis and Design(OOAD)
- Traditional approach of problem decomposition process is either,
	process-centric
	data-centric
- ==Object Oriented approach of problem decomposition process is on capturing the structure and behaviour of information systems into small modules that combines both data and process.==
- Modern object oriented approach to developing information systems must be,
	Use-case driven
	Architecture-centric 
	Iterative and incremental
#### 1. Use-case driven
- Use cases are the primary modeling tools defining the behaviour of the system.
- A use-case describes how the user interact with the system to perform some activities. 
- Use-cases are used to identify and communicate the requirements for the system to the programmers. 
- Use-cases are inherently simple because  they focus on only one business process at a time. 
#### 2. Architecture-Centric 
- Underlying software architecture of the system drives the specification, construction and documentation of the system.
- Object oriented system analysis and design approaches should support three views of a system,
	1. Functional (external)
		External behavior of the system from the user perspective
		Ex: Use-case diagram
	2. Structural (static)
		Describe system attributes, methods, classes  and relationships. 
		Ex: Class diagram
	3. Behavioral (dynamic)
		Describes the behavior of the system in terms of message passed among objects, state changes within objects.
		Ex: Sequence diagram, State machine diagram
#### Iterative and Incremental
- Emphasises iterative and incremental development involving continuous testing and refinement throughout the life cycle.

- System Analyst develop three architectural views little by little,
	1. SA work with users to create a functional representation of the system.(Use case model)
	2. SA build a structural representation of the evolving system. (Class model)
	3. SA build the behavioral representation of the evolving system. (Sequence diagram or an Interaction model)

### Benefits of Object-Oriented Analysis Design
- Help to break complex system into smaller, more-manageable modules.
- Modularity makes the system to communicate easier. 
- Modular components can be reusable. 
- Reusing can save development time.
- Encapsulation and data hiding make the system can not be tempered.
### The Unified Process(UP)
![[Pasted image 20250121145802.png]]
The Unified Process in Object-Oriented Analysis and Design(OOAD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes iterative development, collaboration and flexibility. 
It's based on the UML and is characterized by it use of Use-cases to drive development. 
- Phases,
	1. **Inception** (Do we understand what we are building?)
		Create a business case for the proposed system.
		Key activities : 
			Determine project scope, objectives and feasibility. 
			Identify stakeholders, initial requirements, project outline, risks. 
	2. **Elaboration** (Do we understand how to build it?)
		Project requirements are analysed in more detail. 
		Key activities : 
			Define the architecture. 
			Develop use-cases, architectural baseline, key-component and refine project plan.
	3. **Construction** 
		Develop, test, and integrate the system components and continuously verifying that the system meets the requirements. 
		Goal: Deployable, high-quality software product
	4. **Transition**
		Deploy the software to the end user. 
		Key activities: User training, final system testing and transition of the system to the operations and maintenance team.
- These Phases are iterative and may be visited multiple times throughout the project.
- Workflow includes,
	business modeling,
	requirement analysis,
	design,
	implementation,
	test, 
	deployment, 
	configuration and change management,
	project management

Ex:
	![[Unified_Process_Model_for_Iterative_Development.svg.png]]
	Inception phase initially involves more on business modeling and requirement workflows. 
	Then elaboration phase starts analysis & design.
	Implementation mainly works on constructions phase.
- As the system evolves through the phases, it improves and becomes more complete. 
- Workflows in Unified Process is in two main categories, 
	1. Engineering workflow
		Deal with the activities that produce the technical product
		Ex: Business modeling, Requirement, Analysis and Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment
	2. Supporting workflow
		Focus on the managerial aspects of information systems development.
		Ex: Project management, Configuration and change management, Environment

- **Configuration and change management workflow** : Purpose is to keep track of the evolving system. Mostly associated with construction and transition phases. Comprises artifacts such as diagrams, source code and executables.
- **Environment workflow** : Addresses tools and processes used by the development team during the development process. Can be active during all phases but primarily with the inception phase. 
	Ex: CASE tools, Programming environments, Project management tools, Configuration management tools

#### Issues with Unified Process,
- Doesn't address the staffing, budgeting or contracting management issues.
- Doesn't address the issue related to maintenance, operations or support of the product once it has been delivered. 
- Doesn't address cross or inter project issues. 

Due to these reasons, Unified process is simply a development process rather than a complete software process. 
To address this issue, **Abler** and **Constantine** suggest adding a
	1. Production phase
	2. Operations and support workflow
	3. Infrastructure management workflow

- **Production phase** : Concerned with issue related after the software has been deployed. (Ex: updating, maintenance and operating)
	No iterations and incremental deliverables in this phase. 
	Supporting workflows active during this phase,
		configuration and change management workflow,
		project management workflow,
		new operations and support workflow,
		infrastructure management workflow
#### Refinement of the Unified process
- Rational Unified Process(RUP)
	Created by: Rational software(now owned by IBM)
	Uses a series of software tools along with the framework
- Agile Unified Process(AUP)
	Developed by: Scott Ambler
	A simplified version of the RUP. 
	Describes a simple, easy to understand approach to developing business application software using agile techniques.
- The Open Unified Process(OpenUP)
	Developed by: The Eclipse Foundation
	Part of the "Eclipse Process Framework(EPF)"
	Its goals are to make it easy to adopt the core of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) / Unified Process.
