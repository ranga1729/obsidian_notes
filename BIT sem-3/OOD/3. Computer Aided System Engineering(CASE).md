- Computer Aided Software Engineering(CASE) is the implementation of computer assisted tools and method in software development. 
- CASE also considered as a warehouse to store document related to project such as Business plans, Requirements, Design specifications.
Some tools are used,
	to create diagrams in the analysis workflow,
	to generate code for database in the design workflow,
	throughout the system dev process,
Some tools are established software development support tools like debuggers and compilers. 
Some tools support only planning, analysis and design while some support testing and documentation.

- Examples for tools used for Object oriented development,
	ArgoUML, Visual Paradigm, Enterprise Architect, IBM's Rational Rose
- Types of CASE tools, 
	1. Business Analysis and modeling 
	2. Project management tools
	3. Design and Development tools
	4. Testing tools
	5. Maintenance tools

- Main categories of CASE tools
	1. Classic CASE tools
		Established software dev support tools
		Ex: debuggers, compilers, 
	2. Real CASE tools
		Again categorized into 3 categories,
			1. Upper Case tools
				Used for Planning, Analysis, Design stages of the SDLC.
				Ex: diagram tools such as UML tools.
			2. Lower Case tools
				Used for Implementation, Testing, Maintenance stages of the SDLC.
				Ex: code generation tools
			3. Integrated Case tools
				Refer to both upper and lower case tools. Help in all stages of the SDLC.
				Ex: Visual Paradigm, Enterprise Architect
#### Central Repository
Central repository stores all information related to the project. 
Ex: Product specifications, requirement documents, related reports and diagrams
Real case tools have a central repository but classic case tools don't.

##### Benefits of using Integrated case tools, 
- Tasks can be completed and altered faster. 
- Centralized dev documentations. 
- Support diagramming information.
- Reduce maintenance cost. 
- Short time to market. 
- Reduce defects. 
- Improved software quality.

**Round-Trip engineering** : Refers to the Object-oriented system development in CASE tools. It support not only code generations but also the reverse of UML diagrams form code. 
	Forward engineering : Generate class from class diagram
	Reverse engineering : Generate sequence diagram from the the code.
### Evolution of CASE tools
- Case tools were introduced in 1980. 
- Modeling notation were introduced before graphic editors.
- The first method for document process was, known as the **"Flow process chart"**.

- **Data-flow Diagrams(DFD)** were introduced and used with structured analysis and design in 1970 by Gane and Sarson.
	DFD shows the flow of data from external entities into the system.

- Data modeling was introduced in the 1970. 
- Entity Relationship model was introduced by Peter Chen in 1976. 
	Chens notations.

- Tools used before CASE tools,
	Word processors
	Diagram Editors
	Intelligent Diagram Editors
- CASE was originally used by Nastec Corporation of Southfield, Michigan in 1982.
#### CASE tools in 80's 
- 4GL products
	Devolved form enhanced query language and report generators into application development tools.
	Ex: Nomad, Focus, Dbase III+, Foxpro 1.0
- Analysis tools, Design tools

#### Classification of CASE tools,
1. Diagramming tools 
	Ex: starUML, ArgoUML, MS Visio, Draw.io, LucidChart, Creately, PlantUML
2. Project management tools
	Trello, TeamWork, Basecamp, JIRA(issue tracking), 
3. Documentation tools
	Ex: Doxygen, DrExplain, Adobe, Robohelp, Confluence
4. Configuration Management tools
	Ex: GIT, Docker, Terraform
5. Programming tools
	Ex: Eclipse, Netbeans, Bootstrap, Adobe Dreamweaver, VS code, Android Studio
6. Quality Assurance tools
	Apache JMeter, Lambda Test, TestProject, IBM Rotational Functional Tester, IBM Rotational Perfomance Tester

#### PlantUML  tool
- Open source
- Create diagrams using plain text syntax. 
Ex: 
```uml
@startuml
left to right direction
actor "Food citric" as fc
rectangle Resturant {
	usecase "Eat Food" as UC1
	usecase "Pay for Food" as UC2
	usecase "Drink" as UC3
}
fc --> UC1
fc --> UC2
fc --> UC3
@enduml
```
