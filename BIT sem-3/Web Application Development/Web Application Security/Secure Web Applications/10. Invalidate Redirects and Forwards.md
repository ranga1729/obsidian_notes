- Web applications frequently redirect and forward users to other pages and websites. Without proper validation, attackers can redirect victims to phishing or malware sites, or use forwards to access unauthorized pages.

- Detecting unchecked redirects is easy. Look for redirects where you can set the full URL. Unchecked forwards are harder, since they target internal pages.

- Impact,
	1. Attempt to install malware
	2. Trick victims to disclose passwords or other sensitive information
	3. Unsafe access control bypass

- Vulnerabilities, 
	1. Review the code for all uses of redirect or forward (called a transfer in .NET). For each use, identify if the target URL is included in any parameter values. If so, verify the parameter(s) are validated to contain only an allowed destination, or element of a destination.
	2. Also, spider the site to see if it generates any redirects (HTTP response codes 300-307, typically 302). Look at the parameters supplied prior to the redirect to see if they appear to be a target URL or a piece of such a URL. If so, change the URL target and observe whether the site redirects to the new target
	3. If code is unavailable, check all parameters to see if they look like part of a redirect or forward URL destination and test those that do.

- Prevention,
	1. Avoid using redirects and forwards. 
	2. Don't involve user parameters in calculating the destination.
	3. If destination parameters can’t be avoided, ensure that the supplied value is valid, and authorized for the user.
	4. It is recommended that any such destination parameters be a mapping value, rather than the actual URL or portion of the URL, and that server side code translate this mapping to the target URL.
	5. Applications can use ESAPI to override the `sendRedirect()` method to make sure all redirect destinations are safe.

Ex:
1. The application has a page called “redirect.jsp” which takes a single parameter named “url”. 
	The attacker crafts a malicious URL that redirects users to a malicious site that performs phishing and installs malware. 
	http://www.example.com/redirect.jsp?url=evil.co
2. The application uses forward to route requests between different parts of the site. 
	To facilitate this, some pages use a parameter to indicate where the user should be sent if a transaction is successful. In this case, the attacker crafts a URL that will pass the application’s access control check and then forward the attacker to an administrative function that she would not normally be able to access.
