- Injection is an attacker execute unintended commands or access data by inserting malfunctioned command or a query into the interpreter. 
- SQL, NoSQL,  OS and LDAP(Lightweight Directory Protocol) can be affected. 
![[Pasted image 20250119113531.png]]
- Often found in,
	1. SQL queries
	2. NOSQL queries
	3. OS commands
	4.  LDAP(Lightweight Directory Protocol) queries
	5. XPath queries
	6. XML parsers
	7. SMTP headers
	8. expression languages
	9. ORM queries
- Scanners and fuzzers can help attackers find injection flaws.
- Consequences,
	1. Data loss
	2. Data corruption
	3. Data disclosure to unauthorized parties
	4. Loss of accountability
	5. Denial of access to resources
	6. Complete host takeover

- Vulnerabilities that can lead to injection attacks,
	1. Neglect sanitizing user provided data in the application.
	2. Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter. 
	3. Using/concatenating hostile data directly.

- How to prevent, 
Can be easily discovered by examining the code. 
1. Keep data separate from commands and queries. 
2. Use safe API which avoids the use of the interpreter entirely or provide parameterized interfaces or migrate to use an ORM.
3. Use input validations as needed. 
4. Escape special characters in dynamic queries. 
5. Use `LIMIT` and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass disclosure of records in case of SQL injection.

Additionally,
Can be used automated testing tools to check all parameters, headers, URLs, cookies, JSON, SOAP and XML data inputs. 
Organizations can include static source(SAST) and dynamic application test(DAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify newly introduce injection flaws prior to production deployment.

Ex: 
```mysql
String query = "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID=" + request.getParameter("id");
```
Attacker modifies the 'id' parameter by sending `‘ or ‘1’=’1`\
Then the request will be,
```http
http://example.com/app/accountView?id=' or '1'=‘1
```
