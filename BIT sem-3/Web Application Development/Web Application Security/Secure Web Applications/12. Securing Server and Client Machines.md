#### Server can be secured by,
1. Hardening the server
	Hardening the OS
	Uninstalling unnecessary services
	Using tools like SELinux, grSecurity
2. Using a firewall
	Block connections to all ports except this typically allowed(80, 443, etc)
	Run the firewall at the point where internet meets the network and on the server
#### Securing client application and Apache web server
Methods to secure Apache server when running PHP applications, 
1. SuExec
2. Mod_security

#### 1. SuExec
**SuExec (Switch User Execution)** is a feature of the Apache HTTP Server that allows CGI and SSI programs to run as a user other than the default user (typically `nobody` or `apache`). This is useful for improving security and resource management in shared hosting environments.
Features, 
1. **User-Specific Permissions:** Ensures scripts are executed with the permissions of their owner, not the web server's default user.
2. **Security Isolation:** Helps isolate users, preventing one user's scripts from interfering with or accessing another user's files.
3. **Restrictive Policies:** Scripts must meet strict requirements, such as being owned by a specific user, having correct permissions, and residing within a specific directory.
4. **Error Logging:** Logs execution errors, making debugging easier.
#### 2. Mod_security
An open-source web application firewall (WAF) module for Apache, Nginx, and IIS. It provides a layer of security by intercepting and analysing HTTP requests and responses to detect and mitigate potential threats.
Features,
1. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention:** Detects and blocks malicious requests like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and others.
2. **Request and Response Filtering:** Analyses and filters HTTP traffic based on custom rules.
3. **Logging and Monitoring:** Provides detailed logging for suspicious activity and blocked requests.
4. **Customizable Rules:** Supports a flexible rules engine for tailored security policies, including the popular **OWASP Mod_Security Core Rule Set (CRS)**.
5. **Virtual Patching:** Protects web applications from known vulnerabilities without modifying application code.
