Instead of telling users to go back and try again when they enter invalid data, we can ,
1. Convert HTML special characters
2. Upload files without compromising the filesystem
#### 1. Convert HTML special characters
In some cases users have to enter HTML into our applications.
Ex: In a blog comment system usually allow users to post hyperlinks

If we allow users to enter HTML, we need to convert the HTML special characters to HTML by using the `htmlentities()` functions.
	This function will search and replace HTML special characters.
Ex:
- &(ampersand) becomes `&amp;`
- "(double quotes) become `&quot;`
- '(single quote) becomes `&#039;`
- <(less than) becomes `&lt;` and >(greater than) becomes `%gt;`
#### 2. Upload files without compromising the filesystem
- We can prevent uploading files from `php.ini`,
	``file_upload = off`
Some applications need users to upload files which can lead to,
1. DOS attacks
2. Overwriting existing files
3. Place malicious code on the server for later use

To handle these possible issues,
1. Avoiding DOS attack on the file system
	Limit uploading file size in `php.ini`
	Create a separate file system for uploaded file which can protect the rest of the server.
2. Validating files
	Verify filename extension
	Test for basic file type
	Run the file through and antivirus utility
3. Using FTP functions to ensure safe file upload
	Prevent uploading files from remote servers by disabling `register_globals` and `url_fopen` from `php.ini`
	When using a FTP function, first open the connection, upload the file, then close the connection.
