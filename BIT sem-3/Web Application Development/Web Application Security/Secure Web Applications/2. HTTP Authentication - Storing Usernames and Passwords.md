#### Authentication
Two steps,
1. Identification : Claim to be certain person
2. Confirmation : Prove that claim

Identify confirming factors categorization,
1. Knowledge - Something you know
	Ex: password, pin
2. Possession - Something you have
	Ex: Digital certificate, smart card, Security token
3. Inherence
	Ex: Fingerprint, retinal pattern, hand geometry, topography of the face

#### Two-factor and Three-factor authentication
**Two-Factor:** Validating someone's identity using two factors of the three categories.
Ex: 
	Authenticating at an ATM
	Card: Possession
	PIN: Knowledge
**Three-Factor:** At least having one factor from three categories

#### Password-Based Authentication System
Different username password Authentication systems exist for web applications,
- Basic Access Authentication
	The client sends the user's credentials (username and password) encoded in **Base64** as part of the `Authorization` header in an HTTP request.
- Digest Access Authentication
	Similar to Basic Access Authentication. But instead of sending credentials in plaintext or encoded form, it sends hashed values to improve security.
- Single sing-on solution(SSO)
	An authentication mechanism that allows users to access multiple applications or systems with a single set of login credentials.
- Custom-developed authentication mechanism
#### Built-In HTTP Authentication
HTTP protocol specification provides, 
1. Basic Access Authentication
2. Digest Access Authentication
Both of these have weaknesses so not recommended to use.

#### 1. Basic Access Authentication
User require to enter a username and password before accessing a resource. 
Steps, 
1. User attempts to access a protected resource. Then server will respond with `401 authorization require` response. 
2. Browser will pop up a dialog box to get user credentials. 
3. After submitting the credentials, browser will 
	- Concatenate username and password with a colon `:` in middle 
	- Encode it in **Base64** as part of the `Authorization` header.
	- Submit via GET request.
4. If the credentials are accepted by the server, protected resource returned to the user.

Flaws of Basic authentication,
1. Insecure transmission
	Since data are encoded, not encrypted, attackers can decode them. To secure credentials in transit, it must be submitter over SSL connection or encrypted medium.
2. Repeated exposure
	Credentials must be submitted with every single request for the protected resource. Then it gets expose over and over again.
3. Insecure storage
	Since credentials need to submit with each request, the browser caches the authentication credentials. Since no session is involved, we can't invalidate a session with the server. The only way to clear the stored credentials is to close the tab and clear the history. 

#### 2. Digest Access Authentication
Similar to Basic Access Authentication, except **MD5 hashing algorithm** is used to transform information, before is transmitted.
This method is slightly better than the Basic method. 
But still vulnerable to **MITM(man in the middle)** attacks, since it's possible to trick the client to downgrade the security back to basic method or an older digest method.

#### 3. Single Sing-on Authentication(SSO)
- Single sing on authentication permits user to use on set of credentials to access multiple applications. 
Ex: Google, LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook offer SSO services which enable user to log in to third party applications with their social media authentication credentials. 
- Security risk : Creates a single point of failure for several online accounts all at once.
#### 4. Custom Developed Authentication Mechanisms
Logics coded by developers to process credentials.

#### Validating Credentials
Two considerations of validating credentials,
1. Location of the comparison logic
	Options : 
	1. Within application
	2. Database
2. How the password is stored
	Options:
	1. Plain text
	2. Hashed (Compare the hash value)

*****
#### Attacks Against Passwords
Types,
1. Against live system(online)
	![[Pasted image 20250118161604.png]]
2. Against the hashed or encrypted password value(offline)
	![[Pasted image 20250118161623.png]]

- Common attack variations,
1. Dictionary attack
	Try to find passwords by entering real words. 
2. Brute-force attack
	Attempting every single possible key.
3. Precomputed dictionary attack
	Hashed the dictionaries and store in a disk in advance and used the hash only to match two password hashes. 
4. Rubber-hose attack
	Extracting password from individuals using any sort of physical coercion. 

#### Password Best Practices
- Improve the size of the key and make key space larger
	The number of possible permutations of a set of X characters with length y is calculated with X^Y 
- Regularly change the password
	rotate password at least every 90 days
- Use unique passwords.
- Allow account to be disabled when they are not using it. 
- Properly store passwords
	Use strong hashing
- Use random salt values with each password
	In addition to hashing, use random salt value to increase security
#### Secure Authentication Best Practices
- Secure the transmission by using encrypted channels.
- Lock accounts after certain number of failed logins
- Using CAPTCHAs to reduce brute force attacks.
- Disable account which are not used recently.
- Don't hardcode credentials within the web application.
