- Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly ,allowing attackers to compromise password, keys, session tokens or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other user's identities.

- Attackers have access to hundreds of millions of valid username and password combinations for credential stuffing, default administrative account lists, automated brute force, and dictionary attack tools. Session management attacks are well understood, particularly in relation to unexpired session tokens.
- Attackers can detect broken authentication using manual means and exploit them using automated tools with password lists and dictionary attacks

- The prevalence of broken authentication is widespread due to the design and implementation of most identity and access controls. 

- Impact, 
Attackers have to gain access to only few accounts or one admin account to compromise the system.
1. Money laundering
2. Social security frauds
3. Identity theft
4. Disclose legally protected sensitive information

- Vulnerabilities, 
	1. If attackers has a list of valid usernames and passwords, they can run automated attacks. 
	2. Permit weak passwords.
	3. Uses weak credential recovery and forgot-password methods. 
	4. Use plain-text or weakly hashed passwords.
	5. Missing or ineffective multi-factor methods. 
	6. Exposes session IDs in the URL.
	7. Doesn't rotate session IDs after a successful login. 
	8. Does not properly invalidate session IDs. 

- How to prevent,
	1. Implement multi-factor authentication to prevent automated, credential stuffing, brute force and stolen credential re-use attacks. 
	2. Do not deploy with default credentials for admin users.
	3. Use weak-password checks. 
	4. Align password length, complexity and rotation policies.
	5. Limit failed login attempts. Log all failures and alert administrators when credential stuffing, brute force, or other attacks are detected.
	6. Use a server-side, secure, built-in session manager that generates a new random session ID with high entropy after login.

Ex:
1. Credential stuffing
	Refers to the use of lists of known passwords.
	If an application does not implement automated threat or credential stuffing protections, the application can be used as a password oracle to determine if the credentials are valid
2. Weak password and multi-factor policies.
3. Application session timeouts arenâ€™t set properly
	A user uses a public computer to access an application and forgot to logout. An attacker uses the same browser an hour later, and the user is still authenticated.
