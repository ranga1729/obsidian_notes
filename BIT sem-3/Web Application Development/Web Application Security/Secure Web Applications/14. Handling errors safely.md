Examples,
1. User given information in the URL : John; drop%20table%20users
	If the application is setup to enter user name into database, the query will be like,
	`INSERT INTO users VALUES (John; drop table users);`
	If the database is loosely configured, it will insert 'John' in to the user table and drop the table named 'Users'
2. User input : John’ OR ‘foo’ = ‘foo’--
	When this entered to the username field, 
	`$sql = “SELECT * FROM User WHERE username = ‘John’ OR ‘foo’ = ‘foo’-- ‘ AND password = ‘$_POST[password]’”`
	This query allows the user to log in without a valid username or password.
	In the first phrase in the WHERE clause, the foo = foo is true. Then, the--makes the rest of the query into a comment, effectively invisible in the query.

#### Handle these possible errors,
1. Test for unexpected inputs
	Pass inputs through regular expressions using PHP `preg_match` function to make sure it does not contain any nonalphabetical characters,
2. Handling the unexpected
	Better to redirect user to the input screen and ask them to try again and can be make it more user-friendly by letting users know which fields caused problems.
3. Check all from data
	Since drop downs and radio buttons data also can be manipulated it is better to validate what you expect to receive against what you actually received for all form data.
