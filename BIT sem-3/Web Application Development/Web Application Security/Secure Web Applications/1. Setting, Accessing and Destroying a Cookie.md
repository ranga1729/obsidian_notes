Dynamic web application need a way to store temporary data while visitors work their way way through the application web pages. 
![[Pasted image 20250115162436.png]]

HTTP cookies primarily related to maintaining state and enhancing user experience. 
1. Maintain user sessions across multiple requests. 
	ex: 
		Tracking logged-in users by storing a session ID.
		Remembering items in a shopping cart.
2. Personalization
	Customize user experience based on preferences or behaviors. 
	Ex:
		Remembering user's language, layout settings, theme.
		Suggesting content based on user activity.
3. Tracking and Analytics
	Monitor user behavior and gather analytics. 
	Ex: 
		Serving target ads based on browsing history. 
		Tracking visited pages or time spent on the website for analytics.
4. Persistent Data storage
	Store small pieces of data that persist across sessions.
	Ex: 
		Auto-filling forms with remembered user details.
		Saving user preferences even after the session ends. 
5. Security
	Ex: 
		Implementing CSRF(Cross-Ste Request Forgery) protection by including a unique token in cookies. 
		Preventing unauthorized access by securely identifying user session.

## Cookies
Cookies are data that a server can temporarily store in the browser of each site visitors. When the browser stores cookie data, server can retrieve that information in later transactions with the site visitor. 

This allows the server to identify individual site visitor and keep track of what they are doing within the application. 
This calls a **Web Session**.

Types of cookies, (Based on purpose)
1. **Session Cookie**
	Expires when the client browser window closes. 
	A web server can only retrieve and read the cookies that it sets 
2. **Persistent Cookie**
	Standard type of cookie, Expires at a specific date/time or after a specific length of time. 
	A web server can only retrieve and read the cookies that it sets.
3. **Secure Cookie**
	Cookies transmitted only over HTTPS, ensuring data security during transmission. (Protect sensitive information like authentication tokens.)
4. **HttpOnly Cookie**
	Cookies inaccessible to client-side scripts like JavaScript. Can only be accessed via HTTP. Prevent unauthorized access and enhance security, particularly against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks.
5. **Third-Party Cookies**
	Cookies set by a domain other than the one the user is visiting (e.g., ad networks like Google Ads).
6. **SameSite Cookies**
	Cookies with restrictions on cross-site requests. 
	Can only be sent in requests from the same origin as the target domain

#### How cookie works ?
Steps,
1. User visits a website
	If it's the first visit, there are no cookies associated with the site stored in the browser yet. 
```http
GET /index.php
Host: www.myserver.com
```
2. Server sends a cookie
	The server includes a `Set-Cookie` header in its HTTP response, specifying the cookie's name, value, and attributes (e.g., expiration, domain, path, security).
	The browser stores the cookie locally based on the instructions provided by the server
```http
HTTP/1.0 GET OK
Content-type: text/html
Set-Cookie: name1=value1; attributes
Set-Cookie: name2=value2; attributes
Web page HTML content
```
3. Browser send the cookies back
	For subsequent requests to the same website, the browser includes the cookie in the `Cookie` header of the HTTP request.
    The server can read this information to maintain state or personalize the user experience.
```http
GET /index.php 
Host: www.myserver.com 
Cookie: name1=value1; name2=value2
```

#### Cookie Attributes,
![[Pasted image 20250115174455.png]]
#### Setting Cookies
```http
setcookie(name [, value] [, expire] [, path] [, domain] [, secure] [, httponly]
```
- name : only required parameter
- expire : specify expiration date and time as a time stamp value not as a standard date and time.
- path : set the URL path domain used to set domains allowed to access the cookie.
- last two will specify whether the cookie is secure or httponly. 
Set the cookie before send any HTML content, including the opening tag, since the cookie is part of the HTTP message and not part of the HTML data
Ex:
```http
Set-Cookie: userId=abc123; Expires=Wed, 15 Feb 2025 12:00:00 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict
```
#### Reading Cookies
- The PHP server automatically places all cookies passes from the client in the `$_COOKIE[]` special array variable. 
- The cookie name assigned in the `setcookie()` statement become the associative array key.
	`$_COOKIE['name']`
- When trying to access an expired cookie from the `$_COOKIE[]` array, it will give and error message. 
	Better to check `isset()` before using the cookie.
	`if(isset($_COOKIE['test'])) {...}`
#### Modifying and Deleting Cookies
- Resend a cookie with updates values to modify the cookie. 
- Set the expiration time to a time value in the past to delete a cookie. 
	Ex: Set the time to one second earlier to the current time. 
		`setcookie('test1', ' ', time() -1 )`
