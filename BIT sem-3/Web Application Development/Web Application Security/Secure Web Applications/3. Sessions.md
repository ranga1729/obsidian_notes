#### How PHP handles Sessions
- PHP assigns a unique session ID to each site visitor and stores that as a session cookie in the client browser.
- PHP then stores any data associated with the session in a temporary file located on the actual PHP server. 
- When the session ends, PHP deletes the session files on the server. 
- Only data sent between the client and the server is the session ID value. All other data stored in the server.

#### Sessions vs Cookies

| Aspect            | Sessions                                                | Cookies                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Storage location  | Server(in temporary files or memory)                    | Client browser(key-value pairs)       |
| Data exhcnaged    | Only the session ID                                     | entire data                           |
| Security          | More                                                    | Less(Vulnerable to XSS and tampering) |
| Data lifetime     | Ends when user closes the browser or session times out. | Can persist until the expiration date |
| Data size         | No limit(depends on the server resources)               | Limited to 4KB per cookie             |
| Server dependency | Server resources are required to manage session data    | Fully client side                     |
| Use case          | For sensitive data(ex: user authentication)             | for lightweight, non-sensitive data   |
| Performance       | May affect server performance                           | Faster                                |
| Lifetime control  | Controlled programmatically via server settings         | Can set expiration data               |
| Examples          | Login sessions, shopping cart data                      | Language preferences, usernames       |
#### Starting a session with PHP
- `session_start()` will send required HTTP code to the client browser to create a session cookie.
- PHP assigns a unique ID value to the session cookie.
`session_start()` should come before any HTML code include `<!DOCTYPE>` tag. Need to add this function to the beginning of all the web pages need to access session data. 

#### Storing and retrieving session data
- `$_SESSION[]` array can be used to set or retrieve session data. 
Ex: 
```php
<?php 
	session_start(); // Store session data
	
	$_SESSION['username'] = 'JohnDoe'; 
	$_SESSION['user_id'] = 12345; 

	echo "Your name is ".$_SESSION['username']; 
	echo "Your ID is ".$_SESSION['user_id'];
?>
```

#### Removing session data
Three ways,
1. Remove individual session values
	Use the `unset()` function with the session array variable.
	```php
	unset($_SESSION['Username']);
```
	This only removes the mentioned session array variable and maintain the temp file and the session ID session cookie in the client browser. 
2. `session_unset()`
	Remove all session values at once but keep the session active. 
3. `session_destroy()`
	Removes all session data associated with the session as well as the session ID value assigned to the client browser's session cookie. 
	Able to use anywhere in the PHP application.
