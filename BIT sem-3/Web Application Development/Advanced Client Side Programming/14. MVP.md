MVP = model-view-presenter

The view handles both the request and response parts of the process, taking on the MVC controller's function of communicating with the client.
	This eliminates the communication issue identified in MVC method.

**Model** : Handles the data and the business logic. 
	Role
		Fetch data from the database, API of other sources.
		Perform data processing or computations. 
		Expose data and operations to the presenter. 
	Ex: A `UserRepository` class that fetches user details from an API.

**View** : Displays data to the user and forwards user interactions to the Presenter.
	Role
		Only concerned with UI logic.(showing/hiding elements, animations, etc)
		Interact with the presenter but has no direct knowledge of the model.
		Typically an interface or a concrete UI implementation. 
	Ex: A login screen that displays input fields and a button.

**Presenter** : Acts as the middleman between the view and the model.
	Role
		Receives user actions/events from the view.
		Request data from the Model. 
		Update the view with the processed data or state changes.
		Contains the application logic, making it easy to test.
	Ex: A `LogicPresenter`  that validates input, communicates with the Model for authentication and update the view result. 

Examples,
Commonly used in Android development, particularly with frameworks like Google's recommended architecture.

#### Workflow in MVP,
1. The user interacts with the **View** (e.g., clicks a button).
2. The **View** forwards this action to the **Presenter** through a defined interface.
3. The **Presenter** interacts with the **Model** to fetch or manipulate data based on the user action.
4. The **Model** processes the request and returns the results to the **Presenter**.
5. The **Presenter** processes the results and updates the **View** to reflect the changes.

**Use MVP** if:
- Your application is complex or UI-heavy (e.g., mobile apps).
- Testability is a priority.
- You want complete decoupling between UI and business logic.

**Use MVC** if:
- Your application is small or medium-sized.
- You prefer simpler architectures with less boilerplate code.
- Your framework naturally supports MVC (e.g., web frameworks).

#### Advantages of MVP Over MVC
- **Better Testability**: Since the Presenter is separate from the View, business logic can be unit tested more easily.
- **Tighter Decoupling**: MVP ensures the View and Model are completely isolated, allowing independent development and easier maintenance.
- **Flexibility in UI Changes**: Changing the View implementation does not require changes to the Presenter or Model.
#### Advantages of MVC Over MVP
- **Simpler Architecture**: MVC requires fewer layers, making it more suitable for smaller applications or quick prototypes.
- **Widely Adopted**: MVC is a more traditional approach, often baked into frameworks like ASP.NET MVC or Rails.
