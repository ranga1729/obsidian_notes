DOM helps locating elements in a HTML document in a standard way. 
DOM provides a hierarchical tree structure of elements.
We can access HTML elements by traversing this tree structure.

- Start of the tree structure is always the `HTML` element. 
- All other elements under the root element care called 'child nodes'.
	In this document, html `head` element is the **first child** of the html element and body is the **second child** of the html element.

#### JavaScript and DOM
![[Pasted image 20250110153640.png]]
The browser uses the DOM tree to keep track of all the HTML5 elements, their content and the styles on the web page.

JS has full access to the DOM tree created by the browser as it also works in the client side. JS is capable of modifying the DOM hierarchy. 
**This capability of modifying the DOM helps to add dynamic nature to the front end of the web application.**

JS treats each element in DOM as an object.
Objects have 
1. Properties
	Define information about the objects
2. Methods
	Actions to take with the object

### `document` Object
- JS's `doucment` object is a special object which refers to the entire DOM of an HTML document. 
	To access document's properties we can use `doucment.[propertyName]`
Ex: `var url = document.URL`

Apart from these, JavaScript has built-in properties and methods that apply to each element object in the document.
