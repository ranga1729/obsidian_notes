AJAX helps to produce dynamic content on a web page.

Technologies associated with AJAX,
- JavaScript
- Server side scripting language (PHP, JSP, etc...)
- Extensible Markup Language (XML)
- HTML and CSS
- Document Object Model (DOM)

**Step 1** : JavaScript communicates with web server
**Step 2** : Web server runs PHP program
**Step 3** : PHP program sends data through XML
**Step 4** : JS uses HTML and CSS for styling and positioning data
**Step 5** : JS uses DOM to place data in the web page


> [!NOTE] Important !
> AJAX creates a special JavaScript object that can communicate with web servers.

### XMLHttpRequest
Initially `XMLHTTP ActiveX` object was introduced by Microsoft to connect with the server and retrieving web page's content.
Since most of the other browsers did not adhere to the standards of Microsoft, `XMLHttpRequest` object introduced. 

Methods defined in `XMLHttpRequest` object class,

Ex:
```js
var con = new XMLHttpRequest();
con.open("GET", "search.php", async)
con.send();

//Synchronous : Waits till response arrives to continue
//Asynchronous : Does not wait till the response
```

#### Difference of `GET` and `POST`
**GET**: 
Used to request data from the server.
Data is append to the URL as query parameters. 
	(ex: `example.com?name=John`)
Data is visible in the URL, making it less secure for sensitive information.
Often cached by browsers and can be bookmarked or stored in browser history.
URL parameters are added to the URL itself.
Ex: 
```js
con.open("GET", "myprog.php?id=100&name=rich", true);
con.send();
```

**POST**: 
Used to send data to the server for creating or updating resources. 
Data is sent in the body of the HTTP request.
Data is hidden from the URL, making it more secure for sensitive information.
Not cached by default and cannot be bookmarked.
URL parameters are sent within the send() method.
Ex: 
```js
con.open("GET", "myprog.php", true);
con.send("id=100&name=rich");
```

`XMLHttpRequest` class properties,
![[Pasted image 20250114223557.png]]

States managed by `readyState` property,
- State **0** : The connection has not been initialized.
- State **1** : The connection to the server has been established.
- State **2** : The server received the HTTP request.
- State **3** : The server is processing the HTTP request.
- State **4** : The server sent the response.

### Caching and AJAX
Web browsers are capable of caching the response returned by a specific URL.
It helps to reduce the amount of data the browser must download from the server each time.
Indirectly is helps to minimize the time to load a web page.
#### Issue with caching HTTP requests
When caching is applied to HTTP requests, sent by the XMLHttpRequest object,
Instead of dynamic data to be received, always the cached data will be given.

Simply, the cached response will be used as the valid response for the URL. 

**Solution** : Create a unique URL for each HTTP request.
This can be done by adding a large random number as a GET variable/value pair.
Ex:
```js
var random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
var myurl = "myprog.phpx=" + randm;
con.open("GET", myurl, true)
```
