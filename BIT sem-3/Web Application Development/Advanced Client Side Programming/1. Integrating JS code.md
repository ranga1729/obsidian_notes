### Why JavaScript is important ?
- Adds dynamic nature into the front-end
- Easily be embedded into HTML 5
- Can alter HTML and CSS code
- allows you to alter the text on the web page 'on the fly', without requiring visitors to reload the web page.
### Integrate JavaScript with HTML 5 
Two ways,
1. Embedding the JavaScript code directly into the web page.
2. Creating an external JavaScript file that the browser downloads and runs.
#### 1. Embed JS directly to HTML5 
use `<script>...</script>` tag.
Ex: 
```html
<script>
	//Javascript code goes here
</script>
```
- The browser is capable of identifying the `<script>` tag and executes the code written in JavaScript using the internal JavaScript interpreter. 
- Optionally, the 'type' attribute can be specified. (not necessarily in HTML 5)
	`<script type='text/javascript'>`

##### **Embedded JS in the `<head>` tag**
JavaScript code embedded in the head section runs before the page content is executed.

Ex: 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Testing</title>
		<script>
			alert('Exceutes before the content')
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>This is the web page.</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

##### **Embedded JS in the `<body>` tag**
Embedding JS code inside the body element slows down the loading process of the content.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Testing</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Before executing</h1>
		<script>
			alert('Exceutes before the content')
		</script>
		<h1>After executing</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```


> [!NOTE] Best Practice
> If the code location is not crucial, it is best to place the script element at the end, after the HTML5 code. 

#### 2. Using external JS file
Using external JS file is a good design aspect when the same code repeatedly applicable to many number of web pages. 
It improves the maintainability.

Ex: 
```html
<script src='javascript_code.js'></script>
```
