MVVM = model-view-view_model

Similar to the MVP, but view model acts as a middleman between the view and the model. 

In MVVM, the view-model doesn't manipulate the data as presenter module do in the MVP architecture. 
View-model just provides an interface between the view and the model.

The view-model creates and abstract layer between the view and the model. 
This abstract layer allows the programmer working on the view code.
The mechanism of abstracting helps programmers to work on separate parts without worrying the way data are being processed in the underlying layers. 
Code bases become easily manageable and maintainable.
