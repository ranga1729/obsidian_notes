Variables hold data temporarily in the memory until a program complete its execution.
Variables are names that represent storage locations in the computer memory.
### Rules for defining JS variables
1. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores and collar signs.
2. Names must begin with a letter, and underscores or a collar sign.
3. Variable names are case sensitive.
4. JS keywords(reserved words) are not allowed to used as variable names.

### Declare and initialize a variable
- Use `var` keyword to declare the variable. 
- Give a meaningful name. (Best practice)

Ex:
```js
var name; //Declaration
name = 'Kamal'; //Imnitialization

//OR

var name = 'Kamal'; //Declaration and initialization at the same time.
```
