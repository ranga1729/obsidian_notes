MVC = model-view-controller
MVC architecture splits OOP code into multiple parts of model, view and controller. 
It makes it easier to code and implement the web and separating the user view and data processing components which helps developers to efficiently code and easily maintain the code at a later stage.

**Model** : One or more classes that interact with the application data. (Helps in implementing the business logic to process data, store and manipulate.)
**View** : Displays the application data.
**Controller** : Works as an intermediate for view and model. (Passes the input to the appropriate model class methods for processing)

#### Model
Contains majority of the server-side code.

Provides a common interface between the application data.
The code for model resides between the application and the database table.
	Most MVC implementations uses ORMs(Object Relational Mappings) to provide this interface.
	The ORM class is responsible for handling the methods for all interactions with the underlying table.(CRUD operations)
Works with data storing, retrieving and manipulating as required. 
#### View
Responsible for all the output from the application.
Takes the raw data provided by the model component and display them to the user. 
View component is where all the HTML and CSS code resides. 

Views depends on the screen size and multiple views can be used at the same time. It provides a way of creating applications that support multiple devices.

#### Controller
Accepts requests from the application user and send them to the components required to satisfy the request.

MVC controllers utilize the rewrite rules of webservers.

> [!NOTE] Rewrite Rule 
> A "rewrite rule" in MVC (Model-View-Controller) refers toÂ ==a configuration setting that allows you to modify the incoming URL of a request before it reaches the controller==, essentially changing the apparent URL structure while still directing the request to the correct action within the application, typically used to create cleaner, more user-friendly URLs or handle legacy links.

Through rewrite rules, the URL turns into clean request URL.

### Communication sequence in MVC,
1. Controller receives the request from users.
2. The request will be passed to the appropriate class method implemented in the model.
3. The model class performs the appropriate action related to data. 
4. The model class method passes any resulting data or status to the view. 
5. The view sends a response back to the website with the data.

#### Issue with the MVC : 
- The controller handles client request but not responsible for returning the response.
- The model retrieves data but the view is responsible for the formatting data.
- Its better if the view has the capability to format the data according to the browser environment in the client's end.

Commonly used in web frameworks like ASP.NET MVC, Ruby on Rails, and older desktop applications.
