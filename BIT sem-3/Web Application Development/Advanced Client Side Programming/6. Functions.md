A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single action.
If we have a code segment (complex/simple) repeats over and over in different places, we can write a function and reuse the function without repeating the same code chunk.

JS functions are called using the name of the function and passing the relevant parameters,
Ex: 
`var result = add_values(5, 3);`
