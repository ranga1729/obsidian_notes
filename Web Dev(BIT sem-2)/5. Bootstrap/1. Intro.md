##### Ways of integrating Bootstrap into dev environment,
1. Download the framework and integrate.
	Bootstrap allows 
	1. source code version to download or 
	2. precompiled development ready version or 
	3. third party package managers to install bootstrap. 
	Ex: Package Managers: Npm, RubyGems, yarn, composer and nuget
2. Direct refer the CDN

**1.2 Using compiled CSS and JS**
When downloading and integrating, Bootstrap allows you to download the precompiled development ready version. 
- It includes compiled minfied CSS version, compiled and minfied JavaScript plugins. 
- Source files, bootstrap documentation content and supportive materials are excluded. 
- Can be directly used in a local web development setup.

**Linking external stylesheet into the web page,**
```css
<Link rel="stylesheet" href="local path to css">
```
```js
<script src="local path to js file">
```

**1.1 Source files download**
- Source files can be customized.
- If you download the source file, it's your responsibility to compile it using a suitable compiler. Once you compile the source file you can use it for development purposes. 
	Ex: Libsass, Ruby Sass

```html
<link rel="stylesheetâ€œ 
href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootst
rap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXt

crossorigin="anonymous">
```
JavaScript integration though Bootstrap CDN
```html
<script 
src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstr
ap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" 
integrity="sha384wfSDF2E50Y2D1uUdj0O3uMBJn

```
CDN version of jQuery
```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js"
