**Pre-Processor** is a computer program that modifies data to conform with the input requirements of another program. 

CSS pre-processor is a scripting language that extends CSS and gets compiled into regular CSS syntax, so that it can be read by your browser. It provide functionalities like variables, functions, mixins and operations that allow you to build dynamic CSS.
#### Problems with traditional CSS
- Difficult to maintain
- Lack of Reusability
- Lack of Extensibility

CSS Pre-Processors allow developers to have maintainable, reusable and extensible set of styling instructions.
#### Benefits of using CSS Pre-Processor,
- Better code organization and readability
	Able to reuse stylesheet definition instructions.
- More flexible
	can add conditional statements
- Shareable 
	Able to reuse others code and vise versa
- Cross-browser compatible code generation

### Popular CSS Pre-Processors
- LESS(Learner Style Sheet)
	A NodeJS compiler.
- SASS(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet)
	A ruby compiler.
- Stylus
	NodeJS compiler.
	Work as a dynamic style sheet language.
	It's design is influenced by SASS and LESS.

### SASS (Syntactical Awesome Style Sheet)
This a one of CSS pre-processors which helps to reduce repetition with CSS. It's more stable and powerful CSS extension language that describes the style of document structurally. 
Initially designed by **Hampton Catlin** and developed by **Natalie Weizenbaum** in 2006.
Later **Weizenbaum** and **Chris Eppstien** used its initial version to extend the SASS with SassScript.

#### Why use SASS ?
- It's a super set of CSS, which means it contains all the features of CSS and is an open source pre-processor coded in **Ruby**.
- It uses re-usable methods, logic statements and some of the built-in functions such as color manipulations, mathematics and parameter lists. 
- Efficient than flat CSS and easy to maintain.
- It's more stable, powerful, and compatible with all CSS versions.

#### Disadvantages of SASS
- Takes time for developers to learn SASS.
- When more developers work on the same site collaboratively, SASS requires all of those developers to use SASS.
- There are chances of loosing benefits browser's built-in element inspector.

### LESS (Learner Style Sheet)
LESS was designed by **Alexie Sellier** in 2009 and it's open source.
The first version of LESS was written in Ruby and in later versions it uses JavaScript.
#### Features of LESS
- Cleaner and more readable.
- Able to define styles and it can be reused throughout the code. 
- Based on JavaScript and is a super set of CSS.
- Works as an agile tool that sorts out the code redundancy problems. 

#### Advantages of LESS
- Easily generate CSS that works across browsers.
- Enable you to write better and well-organized code.
- Able to use variables and it makes you edit whole classes easy. 
#### Disadvantages of LESS
- Takes time to learn.
- Since tight coupling between modules, it take more effort to reuse and test dependent modules.
- LESS has less framework. Older preprocessor like SASS consist of Compass, Gravity and Susy frameworks.
#### Examples
1. We can use variables to store repeatedly used styling parameters.

2. We can use nesting syntax for better code quality and make it easy to read.

3. **Mixins**(@mixin) allow documents authors to define patterns of property value pairs, which can then be reused in other rule sets.

4. Using **@extend** enables a selector to inherit the rules of another selector

5. Control instructions

6. **@import** allows you to import another CSS file into your current CSS file.
