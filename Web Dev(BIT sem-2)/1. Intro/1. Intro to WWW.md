In the **World Wide Web**, a client **(Web browser)** communicates with a server **(Web server)** to request for **Hypertext Documents** with a **Hypertext Transfer protocol(HTTP)**.

**Tim Berners-Lee** invented WWW in 1989 and he invented HTML in 1991.
HTML5 final recommendation standards were released in 2014 by W3C.

#### Types of Server in WWW
1. Web servers
	Ex:
		Apache/IIS(Internet Information Service)
		Tomcat(Apache group/PSW(Microsoft Personal Web Server))
2. Database Servers
	Ex: 
		MySQL
		Oracle
3. Video Servers
	Ex: 
		PLEX - Media Server,
		Subsonic - Personal Media Streamer
		Madsonic - Music Streamer
		Gerbera - UPnP Media Server
		Tvmobil - Smart TV Media Server
		OpenELEC - Open Embedded Linux Entertainer Center
4. Mail Servers(Send and receive emails)
	Ex: Zimba, PostFix, Kolab, Mozilla, Thunderbird
5. SMS Servers
	Ex: SmsGate Pro, Sms Server, Sms Fateway, Sms software
6. File and print Servers
#### URL
URL **(Uniform Resource Locator)** is a specific character string that constitutes a reference to a resource. 
Ex: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQDeozGDYDk&t=4797s

Structure of a URL : **scheme://host.domain:port/path/filename**
- scheme - type of internet service(most common http/https)
- host - defines the domain host(default host for http is www)
- domain - defines the internet domain name(youtube.com)
- port - port number at the host(default for http is 80)
- path - path at the server for require page/resource(if omitted: root directory of the site)
- filename - define the name of the document/resource
#### How Web Works
![[image011.jpg]]
1. User types a URL in the web browser.
2. Web browser contact the **Domain Name Service**(DNS) to find the **IP address** of the server associated with the domain name in URL.
3. Web browser creates a **TCP Socket connection(Transmission Control Protocol)** to the server using the servers IP address and port number.
4. Web browser sends an **HTTP request** to the server asking for the file pointed by the URL. 
5. Server determines the file to be sent.
6. Server sends response code and the document. 

#### Web 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0
![[Pasted image 20240315131112.png]]

**Web 1.0** (shopping carts & static web)
- "Readable" phase of the web with flat data. Limited interactions between sites and user.
- Worked as a 'information portal' where users passively receive information without being given the opportunity to post reviews, comments and feedbacks.
- During this era of the web, millions of static websites got lot more investments which eventually led to the dotcom bubble. 
	The dot-com boom refers to the **speculative investment bubble that formed around Internet companies between 1995 and 2000**. The soaring prices of Internet start-ups encouraged investors to pour more money into any company with a “.com” or an “e-something” in its business plan.

**Web 2.0** (The writing & participating web)
- "Writable" era of the web with interactive data. This facilitates interactions between web user and sites.
- Encouraged participating, collaborations and information sharing.
- Ex: YouTube, Wiki, Facebook and etc..

**Web 3.0** (The semantic executing web)
- "Executable" era of the web with Dynamic applications, interactive services and machine-to-machine interactions. 
- Web 3.0 is a semantic web which refers to the future. 'Semantic markup' refers to the communication gap between human web users and computerized applications. 
- In web 3.0, computers can interpret information like humans and intelligently generate and distribute useful content tailored to the needs of users. 
- Parts of Web 3.0,
	Tailor made search
	Personalized search
	Evolution of 3D web
	Deductive Reasoning

**Web 4.0** (Mobile web)
This is not really a new version, but an alternative version of what we have today. Web needed to adapt to it's mobile surroundings and connects all devices in the real and virtual world in real-time.

**Web 5.0** : Open, Linked, Intelligent and Emotional web
(conceptual for now)
