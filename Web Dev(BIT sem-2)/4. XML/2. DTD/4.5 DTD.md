DTD(Document Type Definition) is a set of rules written in a separate file using a specific(non-XML) language to specify XML grammar. Works as a blueprint of XML documents and focuses on the structure of the XML document. 
#### DTD Document Structure
![[Pasted image 20240416183159.png]]
The DTD typically starts with a line that specifies,
1. **< !DOCTYPE** : Indicates the beginning of the DTD.
2. **root_element** : Identifies the name of the root element.(top level element that all other elements resides within)
3. **<code>&#91</code>SYSTEM "system_identifier"<code>&#93</code>** : (Optional) Specifies the location of an external DTD file if you are using one. Otherwise, the DTD definitions are included within the same document itself(internal subset).
4. **<code>&#91</code>internal_subset<code>&#93</code>** : Actual element, attribute and entity declarations are placed within square brackets. 

This **Internal subset** includes mainly,
1. Element declarations
2. Entity declaration
3. Attribute declarations
---
### 1. Element Declaration
This defines the elements allowed in your document.
```DTD
<!ELEMENT element_name content_model> 
```
- **element_name** : name of the element
- **content_model** : specifies what can be contained within the element. 

Option available for **content model**,
1. **(#PCDATA)** : A keyword. Specifies that the ==element can contain only parsed character data(plain text).==
Ex: 
```DTD
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
//allows the `title` element to contain only text.
```

2. **EMPTY** : A keyword. Declare an element that has no content. Means this ==element can not contain any text or other child element.== 
Ex:
```DTD
<!ELEMENT br EMPTY>
```

3. **ANY** : A keyword. This allows element can contain any combination of parsed character data(text) and elements declared within the DTD. ==Means this can have any text, elements or both in any order and repeated any number of times.== This keyword used less frequently as it allows more flexibility but offers weaker validation. 

5. **Child Elements** : List element names within parentheses to specify that the ==element can contain a sequence of those child elements. The order you list them becomes the required order in which they must appear within the parent element.==
Ex:
```dtd
<!ELEMENT book (title, author, year)>
//this defines a 'book' element that must have three child element 'title', 'author' and 'year' in that specific order.
```

5. **OR(|)** : This pipe symbol act as an OR operator. Use it to define that the ==elements can contain one or other of the listed elements, **but not both simultaneously**.==
Ex:
```dtd
<!ELEMENT notification (message | error)>
//'notification' element can have either a 'message' element or 'error' element. But not both. 
```

6. **PLUS(+), STAR(<code>&#42</code>) and Question Mark(?)** : 
- PLUS(+) indicates that the preceding ==element can appear **one or more time.(at least one time)**==
- STAR(<code>&#42</code>) indicates that the preceding ==element can appear **zero or more time. (including not at all)==
- Question mark(?) indicates that the preceding ==element can appear **zero or one times.(either one time or not at all)**==
Ex:
```dtd
<!ELEMENT article (heading, paragraph+)>
//'article' element must have a 'heading' element one time followed by one or more 'paragraph' elements.

<!ELEMENT article (heading, paragraph*)>
//'article' element must have a 'heading' element one time followed by zero or more 'paragraph' elements.

<!ELEMENT article (heading, paragraph?)>
//'article' element must have a 'heading' element one time followed by zero or one 'paragraph' elements.
```

**Summary**
- Comma is used to indicate ordered sequence
	(foo, bar, bat)
- Pipe is used to indicate choices.
	(foo | bar | bat)
- Brackets can be used to create nested sequences and choices. 
	(foo, bar, (bat | mumble))
	(foo | (bar, bat))
- Comma(,), Question mark(?), Star(<code>&#42</code>) and Plus(+) symbols are used to set occurrences count for individual elements or groups of sequence and choices.
	Exactly one : (foo, bar)
	Zero or one : (foo, bar)?
	Zero or more : (foo | bar)*
	One or more : (foo | bar)+

Ex: 
DTD document.
```dtd
<!DOCTYPE catalog [ 
	<!ELEMENT catalog (book+)> 
	<!ELEMENT book (title, author, year)> 
	<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)> 
	<!ELEMENT author (#PCDATA)> 
	<!ELEMENT year (#PCDATA)> 
	<!ATTLIST book id ID #REQUIRED> 
]>
```
Explanation
- `<!DOCTYPE catalog` : defines 'catalog' as the root element.
- `<!ELEMENT catalog (book+)>`
	defines the 'catalog' element to contain one or more 'book' elements.
- `<!ELEMENT book (title, author, year)>`
	defines the 'book' element to have elements 'title', 'author', and 'year' in that order.
- Individual elements 'title', 'author' and 'year' are defined to contain plain text data. (#PCDATA)
- `<!ATTLIST book id ID #REQUIRED>`
	Defines an attribute named 'id' for the 'book' element. 
	It must be of type 'ID' (unique identifier) and is required 
	(#REQUIRED).

Using this DTD, we can create this XML document.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<!DOCTYPE catalog SYSTEM "book_catalog.dtd">
<catalog> 
	<book id="bk101"> 
		<title>The Lord of the Rings</title>
		<author>J.R.R. Tolkien</author>
		<year>1954</year>
	</book> 
	<book id="bk202"> 
		<title>Pride and Prejudice</title>
		<author>Jane Austen</author>
		<year>1813</year> 
	</book> 
</catalog>
```
Notice that `catalog` is the root element in the DTD and in XML, `catalog` is the name of the root element. Within that root element, there can be 'one or more' book elements. 
`title`, `author` and `year` are all text data(#PCDATA) as mentioned in the DTD. 

---
### 2. Entity Declaration
Entities define shortcut for reusable pieces of text or elements.
Entities are mainly in two categories,
1. General Entities for use in document
2. Parameter Entities for use in DTD
#### 1. General Entities
Act as a reusable snippet of text or markup within an XML document.
```dtd
<!ENTITY name "text">
```
- **name** : This is a unique identifier you choose for the entity.
- **text** : The actual text or character data that will be substituted when the entity is encountered. 
Ex:
DTD document
```dtd
<!ENTITY copyright "Copyright &copy; 2024 W3Schools.com">
<!ELEMENT book (title, author, year)>
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT author (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT year (#PCDATA)>
```
Using above DTD, we can create this XML document.
```xml
<catalog>
  <book>
    <title>Learning XML</title>
    <author>Eric Freeman</author>
    <year>2000</year>
    &copyright;
  </book>
  </catalog>
```
Explanation,
- In the DTD, an entity named `copyright` is defined with the replacement text `Copyright &copy; 2024 W3Schools.com`.
- In the XML document, instead of repeating the entire copyright text for each book, the entity `&copyright;` is used. The parser will substitute this with the actual text defined in the DTD.
#### 2. Parameter Entities
Used to define variables within the DTD that can be referenced elsewhere in the DTD. 
```dtd
<!ENTITY % parameter "text">
```
- **%** : indicates a parameter entity.
- **parameter** : A unique identifier for the parameter entity.
- **text** : This represents the actual content the parameter entity will hold.
Ex:
```dtd
<!ELEMENT book (title, author)> 
<!ELEMENT author (name, email)> 
<!ENTITY % attType CDATA> 
<!ATTLIST book 
	isbn (%attType;) 
	edition (%attType;)>
```
Ex:
```dtd
<!ENTITY % booblean '(true | false)'>
<!ENTITY % html SYSTEM 'html.dtd'>
<!ATTLIST person cool %boolean; #IMPLIED>
```

---
### 3. Attribute Declaration
Optional. Defines the attributes that can be associated with specific elements. 
```dtd
<!ATTLIST element_name att_name att_type default_value?>
```
- **element_name** : The element the attribute applies to.
- **att_name** : the name of the attribute.
- **att_type** : the data type of the attribute(ex: CDATA, ID)
- **default_value** : optional. the default value for the attribute if not specified in the XML document itself.
#### Data Types for attributes,
1. **CDATA**(Character Data)
	Allows string characters including spaces, special characters and even markup within the attribute value(if properly escaped). Basically plain text. 
2. **ID / IDREF / IDREFS**
	- **ID** :Defines a unique identifier within the document. An attribute with this type ensures that no two elements have the same value for that attribute. 
	 - **IDREF**: Specifies a reference to the ID of another element within the document. It creates a link between elements, ensuring the reference ID actually exists. 
	- **IDREFS** : Similar to IDREF but allows multiple ID references. The attribute value can contain a space-separated list of ID references.
3. **NMTOKEN / NMTOKENS**
	- **NMTOKEN**: This restricts the attribute value to a single word composed of letters, numbers, hyphens(-), underscores(<code>&#95</code>), or periods(.). It essentially allows alphanumeric values with some special characters for separation. 
	- **NMTOKENS** : This allows a space-separated list of NMTOKEN values. It's essentially a way to define multiple words separated by spaces, following the same restrictions as NMTOKEN. Imagine a list of tags or keywords associated with an element. 
4. **ENTITY / ENTITIES**
	- **ENTITY** : allows the attribute to be replaced by the content of a predefined entity declared within the DTD.
	- **ENTITIES** : Similar to ENTITY, but allows multiple entities to be referenced. The attribute value can contain a space-separated list of entity names. 
5. **NOTATION**
	It specifies that the attribute value must match the name of a notation declared in the DTD. 
	Notations are typically used to declare the format of non-XML data within an XML document.
6. **Enumeration of values**
	An attribute can be restricted to a set of specific values using enumerations. This is done by listing all possible values separated by vertical bar ( | ). the attribute value must match one of the enumerated values.
#### Default Values for attributes
1. **#REQUIRED**
	This keyword signifies that the attribute must be explicitly specified in the XML document for each element where it's declared. 
	If the attribute is missing, the entire XML document will be considered invalid during the validation. 
	It enforces the presence of the attribute for data integrity. 
2. **#IMPLIED** 
	This keyword indicates that the attribute is optional. If not explicitly mentioned in the xml, document will still be considered valid. 
	It simply gives flexibility in specifying the attribute if needed. 
3. **#FIXED**
	This keyword defines a fixed value for the attribute. The attribute value can not be changed in the XML document. 
	Acts like a constant value. Useful for attributes that should always have the same value across all elements.
4. Default value(if not specified)

Ex:
DTD declaration.
```dtd
<!ELEMENT bookstore (book*)>
<!ELEMENT book (title, author, genre, price)>
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT author (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT genre (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT price (#PCDATA)>

<!ATTLIST book
    id ID #REQUIRED
    language NMTOKEN #IMPLIED
    category (fiction|non-fiction) "fiction"
    format NOTATION (hardcover|paperback) #FIXED "paperback"
    isbn CDATA #REQUIRED
    publisher ENTITY #IMPLIED
    keywords ENTITIES #IMPLIED
    relatedBooks IDREFS #IMPLIED
>

```
Explanation
- `id` specifies and ID attribute for each book which is required.
- `language` specifies the language of the books as a NMTOKEN and it's optional. 
- `category` specifies the category of the book with a default value of "fiction." It's a enumeration with options including 'fiction' and 'non-fiction'.
- `format` specifies the format of the book with an enumeration of values (hardcover, paperback) and a fixed value of 'paperback'.
- `isbn` specifies the ISBN of the book which is required and can contain any characters.  
- `publisher` specifies the publisher of the book as an entity reference, which is optional. 
- `keywords` specifies keywords associated with the book as a space-separated list of entities, which is optional. 
- `relatedBooks` specifies related books by referencing their IDs, which is optional. 

Using the above DTD, we can create this XML document.
```dtd
<!DOCTYPE bookstore SYSTEM "bookstore.dtd">
<bookstore>
    <book id="B001" isbn="978-0061120084" publisher="Penguin">
        <title>The Catcher in the Rye</title>
        <author>J.D. Salinger</author>
        <genre>Novel</genre>
        <price>$10.99</price>
        <relatedBooks>B002 B003</relatedBooks>
    </book>
    <book id="B002" isbn="978-0140283297" publisher="Penguin">
        <title>1984</title>
        <author>George Orwell</author>
        <genre>Dystopian Fiction</genre>
        <price>$8.99</price>
        <relatedBooks>B001 B003</relatedBooks>
    </book>
    <book id="B003" isbn="978-0547928227" publisher="Houghton Mifflin Harcourt">
        <title>The Hobbit</title>
        <author>J.R.R. Tolkien</author>
        <genre>Fantasy</genre>
        <price>$9.99</price>
        <relatedBooks>B001 B002</relatedBooks>
    </book>
</bookstore>
```

### ELEMENTS vs ATTRIBUTES
#### **Elements**
**Building blocks of the structure of the XML doc**
	Elements are the fundamental units of structure in an XML document. They represent logical components or containers for data. 
**Allows to do Nesting**
	Elements can be nested within each other, forming a hierarchical structure. This allows to define complex relationships within your data.
**Content can be text or another element**
	Elements can contain text data(character data) or other elements. 
Ex: An element `book` can contain elements like `title, author, year`.

#### Attributes
**Used to provide Additional Information for elements**
	Attributes are used to provide additional details or properties about an element. 
**Key-value pairs**
	Attributes consist of a name-value pair. The name identifies the attribute and the value provides specific information related to the element. 
**Doesn't allow to do Nesting**
	Attributes are associated with a single element and cannot nested within each other. 
Ex: `id`, `genre`, `langauge`, `color`, `size`

**Summary**

| Feature    | Elements                                                                         | Attributes                                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Purpose    | Fundamental building blocks of the XML doc, Define structure and data hierarchy. | Provide additional information about elements.   |
| Nesting    | yes                                                                              | No                                               |
