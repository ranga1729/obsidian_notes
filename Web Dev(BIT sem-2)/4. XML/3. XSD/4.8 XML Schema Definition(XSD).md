XML Schema(A.K.A. XML Schema Definition - XSD) is a grammar definition language, like DTDs but better. unlike DTDs using a separate syntax, schema languages use XML syntax. 
XML Schema(XSD) is Defined by W3C.

Primary features comparing to DTD,
- XSD has more data types including integer, float, dates etc...
- XSD has more powerful content models.
	Ex: namespace-aware, type derivation

### XML Schema Types
XML schema types define the kind of data that can be stored within element and attributes of an XML document. There are two main categories of XML types,
1. **Simple Types** - These are basic types like numbers, dates and booleans. XML schemas come with a built-in set of simple types including,
	**xs : string** - Text data
	**xs : decimal** & **xs : integer** - Numbers(decimal and whole)
	**xs : boolean** - True & False
	**xs : date**, **xs : time**, **xs : dateTime** - Date and time formats
2. **Complex Types** - These allows you to define more intricate structures for your data. They can group elements together or define elements that can contain other elements and attributes. This enables you to build hierarchical data structure within your XML document.
