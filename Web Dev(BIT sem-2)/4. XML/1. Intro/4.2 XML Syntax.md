#### Key point regarding XML syntax,
1. An XML document must have a single root element that encompasses everything else. 
2. Elements are defined by opening tags(`<tag>`) and closing tags(`</tag>`)
3. Names are case sensitive. 
4. Elements can have attributes, which are name-value pairs within the opening tags(Ex: `<tag attribute='value'>`) Attribute values must be in quotes. 
5. Every opening tags must have a corresponding closing tag.
6. Elements can be nested within other elements, but nesting must be proper.(no overlaps)
7. Whitespace is generally preserved but newlines are converted to a special character called 'Line Feed'(LF).
	In HTML multiple whitespaces are truncated into a single whitespace but XML will preserve the multiple whitespaces.
#### Basic Document Structure 
1. Element tags - Building blocks that defines the structure and meaning of your data. They consist of,
	1. Opening tags
	2. Closing tags
	3. Attributes(optional)
2. Element Content - Data contained within an element. It can be,
	1. Text content
	2. Nested elements
3. Miscellaneous tags
	- XML Declaration(optional): This line appears at the very beginning and specifies the XML version and encoding. (Ex: `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">`)
	- Comments: Enclosed within `<! -- comment -- >` and ignored by the machine. 
	- Processing Instructions: Instructions for specific software and start with `<?` and end with `?>`.
