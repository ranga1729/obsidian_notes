### XML Validation
XML validation is the process of checking an XML document to ensure it adheres to specific rules and structure. It goes beyond simply checking if the document is well-formed(basic grammatical rules of XML).

XML validation involves,
1. Well-Formedness check
	First step of the validation.
	Verifies if the document follows the fundamental XML syntax rules. 
	Ex: Check for a proper root element, matching opening and closing tags, proper nesting elements. 
2. Grammar check
	Verifies that the structure and content of the document follows rules specified by the grammar.(DTD/Schema)
#### Grammars
Two main types of grammar used in XML validation,
1. Document Type Definition(DTD)
2. XML Schema/XML Schema Definition(XSD)
#### 1. DTD(Document Type Definition)
This is the classic way to specify XML grammar. It is a set of rules written in a separate file using specific syntax(non-XML syntax). 
This use a subset borrowed from SGML.
It works as a blueprint of a XML document and focuses on the structure of the document. 
DTD defines,
1. Allowed elements and their attributes
2. The nesting structure.
3. The order in which elements can contain
4. The type of content elements can contain
DTD are relatively simple and easy to understand.

Limitations of DTD,
1. Limited data types support.(basically string and integer)
2. No support for namespaces(combining vocabularies from different sources)
3. Not as human-readable at some points.

#### 2. XSD/Schema(XML Schema Definition)
This is a more modern and powerful approach to XML grammar. XSDs are written in XML itself, making them easier for human to read and maintain. 
XSD is the standard and W3C recommended language for defining structure and data types for XML.
They offer several advantages over DTDs,
1. Wide range of data types(support data types like dates, decimals,...)
2. Namespace support, allowing elements from different vocabularies.
3. More expressive for defining complex content models.

There are some additional Schema languages used for XML validation not as widely used as DTDs or XSDs. 
Ex:
	**Relax NG(RNG)**: offers balance between simplicity(like DTD) and expressiveness(like XSDs).
	**Schematron**: Can be used in conjunction with DTDs or XSDs to define additional constraints and rules for XML documents.
