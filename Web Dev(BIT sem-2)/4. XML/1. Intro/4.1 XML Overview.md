### What is XML ?
XML stands for **"Extensible Markup Language"**. 
The idea of using codes or "tags" to markup(like HTML)  a document forms the basis of SGML - the **"Standard Generalized Markup Language"** which an ISO standard(ISO 8879:1986) for marking up a document. 
HTML is a subset of SGML. The full SGML specifications would be very expensive to implement and goes beyond the need of the great majority of web users. 
XML is designed by W3C member companies. Like HTML, XML is also based on SGML. 
Key differences between HTML and XML,
1. XML is extensible.
	XML merely describe a syntax for markup. The names of the tags are not set in concrete and authors can 'invent' them as appropriate. 
	Where as HTML provides fixed repertoires of names tags like P, H1, UL,...
2. XML is the standard markup language for data
	XML constitutes a more flexible way of marking up data, storing data and transporting data itself while HTML focuses on how data is displayed. 

In a most simplest way,
	HTML defines 'visual' document layout like paragraphs, images and etc... while XML defines semantic structure for data and strict definition for document syntax. 

#### Basic rules,
1. XML is case sensitive.
2. All start tags must have a end tags.
3. Elements must be properly nested. 
4. XML declaration is the first statement. 
5. Every document must contain a root element. 
6. Attribute values must have quotation marks. 
7. Certain characters are reserved for parsing.
#### Common Error for Element Naming
1. Do not use white space when creating names for elements.
2. Element names can not begin with a digit, although names can contain digits.
3. Only certain punctuations are allowed - periods, colons and hyphens.

### Legal Building Blocks of XML
A **Document Type Definition(DTD)** allows the developer to create a set of rules to specify legal content and place restrictions on an XML file. 
If the XML document does not follow the rules contained within the DTD, a parser generates an error.
An XML document that conforms to the rules within a DTD is said to be valid. 
#### Why use a DTD ?
- A single DTD ensures a common format for each XML document that references it. 
- An application can use a standard DTD to verify that data that it receives from outside world is valid. 
- A description of legal, valid data further contributes to the interoperability and efficiency of using XML.

Ex:
**HTML** - Marking up the visual
```html
<table border='1'>
	<tr style='background:black; color:white'>
		<th>Item
		<th>Price
	</tr>
	<tr valign='top' style='background:silver'>
		<td>BK123 - <u>Care and Feeding of Wombats</u>
		<td>$42.00
	</tr>
</table>
```

Here the same thing in **XML** - Marking up data
```xml
<order>
	<item code='BK123'>
		<name>Care and Feeding of Wombats</name>
		<price currency='USD'>42.00</price>
	</item>
</order>
```

#### The Business Connections
- Protocol independence
	Eases intra-business communication. 
	Allows information interchange with partners.
- Platform independence
	- Bridges legacy systems to new applications.
- Open standard
	- Freedom from data control(Ex: EDI)
	- Everyone 'speaks' the same language.
