Conditional statements in XSLT allow you to control the output of your transformation based on certain conditions within the XML data you are processing. 
Two main ways,
1. `xsl:if` 
2. `xsl:choose`

#### 1. `xsl:if` element
Used for simple if/then scenarios.
It evaluates an XPath expression and if the expression results in a true values, the content within the `xsl:if` element is processed and included in the output.
```xml
<xsl:if test='expression'> ... </xsl:if>
```
#### 2. `xsl:choose`
Used for more comprehensive if/else functionality.
You can specify multiple conditions with `xsl:when`, and the processor will execute the content within the first `xsl:when` that evaluates to true. 
If none of the conditions are met, the content within `xsl:otherwise` is processed. 
```xml
<xsl:choose>
	<xsl:when test='expression'> ...</xsl:when>
	<xsl:otherwise> ... </xsl:otherwise>
</xsl:choose>
```
