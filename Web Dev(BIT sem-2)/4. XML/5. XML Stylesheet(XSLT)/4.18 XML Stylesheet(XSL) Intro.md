**XSL** stands for **Extensible Stylesheet Language**. It's a family of three interrelated language that work together. 
1. XSL Transformation(XSLT)
	This is the core language and is used to transform XML document into other formats. 
	Ex: XSLT can be used to convert a XML file with customer data into a user-friendly HTML table. 
2. XML Path Language(XPath)
	XPath allows XSLT to target specific parts of an XML document for transformation.
3. XSL Formatting Objects(XSL-FO)
	This is an XML vocabulary for defining how an XML document should be formatted output. 
	While XSLT can convert an XML file to HTML, XSL-FO can be used to specify things like fonts, margins and layout for the generated HTML. 
Ex:
Empty XSLT document.
```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-16'?>
	<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl='http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform' version='1.0'>
	...
	...
</xsl:stylesheet>
```
