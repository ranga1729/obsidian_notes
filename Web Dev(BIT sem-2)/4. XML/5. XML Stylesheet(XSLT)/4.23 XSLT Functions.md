XSLT functions are pre-defined building blocks within XSL Transformations (XSLT) that allow you to manipulate and process XML data.
Key characteristics of XSLT functions,
- XSLT functions are typically used within XPath expressions, which are used for selecting and manipulating data from XML documents. 
- Many functions accept parameters that provide input values and they return a specific data type as output. 
- Most XSLT functions belongs to the namespaces `fn`. 

Ex: 
String manipulation
	`substring`, `concat`, `translate`
Numeric operations
	`sum`, `product`, `floor`
Date and time handling
	`format-date`, `current-date`
Boolean logic
	`not`, `or`, `and`
Node selection and manipulation
	`name`, `position`, `local`, `name`
Testing and comparison
	`contains`, `compare`, `equals`
