XSLT doesn't have loops in the traditional sense like 'for' loop in many programming languages. But XSLT offers mechanism to achieve similar iterative processing through,

`xsl:for-each` element is the primary method for looping through elements in your XML data. It specifies an XPath expression that selects a set of nodes. 

Ex:
```xml
<books> 
	<book> 
		<title>The Lord of the Rings</title> 
	</book> 
	<book> 
		<title>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</title>
	</book> 
	<book> 
		<title>Pride and Prejudice</title> 
		</book>
</books>
```
Here's an XSLT stylesheet that loops through each book and creates a formatted list:
```xml
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

<xsl:template match='/'>
	<html>
		<body>
			<h1>My Book List</h1>
			<ul>
				<xsl:for-each select='books/book'>
					<li>
						<xsl:value-of select='title'/>
					</li>
				</xsl:for-each>
			</ul>
		</body>
	</html>
</xsl:stylesheet>
```
