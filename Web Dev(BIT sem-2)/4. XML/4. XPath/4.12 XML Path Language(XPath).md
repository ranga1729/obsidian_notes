XPath, XML Path Language is a query language specifically designed for navigating and extracting data from XML documents(XML trees and JSON trees). It's like a special syntax that lets you pinpoint the exact location you're interested in within an XML document's structure. 
Usage,
- We can use XPath expression to move between elements, attributes and other nodes within the document.
- XPath uses a path-like syntax to reach the desired nodes based on their location, names or attributes. 
- XPath offers basic capabilities for manipulating strings, numbers and boolean values extracted from the XML document.   

#### Location Path & XPath Expression
**Location Path** direct you to a specific location of a XML document. 
**XPath Expressions** allows you to select nodes in that XML document. Location Path is a part of the whole XPath Expression.

In  other words,
**Location paths** provide the roadmap within an **XPath expression**, specifying the steps to reach the desired nodes. The full XPath expression builds upon the location path, potentially including a predicate for further filtering.
Ex for location paths:
	`/bookStore` : Selects the root element names "bookstore"
	`bookStore/book` : Selects all "book" elements that are direct children of the "bookstore" element.(child axis)
	`//price` : Select all "Price" elements anywhere within the document. (descendant axis with wildcard node test)
	`book/@id` : Selects the "id" attribute of all "book" elements. (attribute axis)
#### Key Components/Steps of a Location Path Expression
**XPath Expression = (AxisSpecifier NodeTest (Predicate)?)**
1. **Axes** : Defines the direction you navigate in the XML hierarchy. 
2. **Node Tests** : Specifies the type of node you want to select. 
3. **Predicate** : (optional) This is an expression enclosed in square brackets ([]) that filters nodes based on specific conditions. Predicates can use functions, comparisons and logical operators for fine-grain selections.
#### Additional
- Forward slash (`/`) can be used to chain multiple steps together and navigate deeper into the XML structure. 
- Absolute paths start with a forward slash (`/`) and navigate from the document root. But relative paths start from the current node.
- Wildcards (`*`) can be used in node test for broader selection.

Results of a XPath Expression can be,
1. **Set of Nodes** : Set of nodes that match the criteria specified in the expression. These nodes can be element, attributes or even text nodes. 
	Ex: `//book` might return a set containing all `<book>` element in the document. 
2. **Single Node** : This could be achieved using a combination of axes, node tests and predicates to targeted a specific and unique node.
	Ex: `//author[@name="J.R.R. Tolkien"]` will return a single `<author>` element with the matching attribute. 
3. **Boolean** : Often achieved using functions or comparisons within predicates. 
	Ex: `count(//book > 5)` might evaluate to true if there are more than 5 `<book>` elements.
4. **String** : Selecting text nodes (`text()`) will return the text content of those nodes as strings. 
	Ex: `//title/text()`
	XPath offers a variety that operate on strings,
	`substring(string, start, length)` : Extract a substring
	`string-length(string)` : Returns the length of a string
	`concat(string1, string2)` : Concatenate two strings
5. **Number** : XPath can implicitly convert numbers extracted from elements or attribute into strings. 
	Ex: `//book/price` would technically return the price but it will automatically converted to a string representation.
	XPath offers numeric functions and comparisons,
	`number(string)` : Converts a string to a number.(if possible)
	`sum(node-set)` : Calculate the sum of numeric values within a node set.
	`count(node-set)` : Return the number of nodes in a set.
