In java string is a sequence(an array) of characters and it was implemented as objects of type "String".

The **String, StringBuffer** and **StringBuilder** classes are defined in **java.lang**. They all are available to all programs. All are declared final(none of them can be subclassed.) All three implement the **CharSequence** interface. 

The content of a object type String cannot be changed after it has been created. But String references can be changed to point at some other String object at any time. 

### The String Constructor
The String class supports several constructors. 
1. To create an empty string.
```java
String s = new String();
```

2. To create an String initialized by an array of characters.
```java
char chars[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
String s = new String(chars);
```
You can specify a subrange of a character array using this constructor.
	```
```
	String(char chars[], int startIndex, int numChars)
	
	startIndex : begining of the subrange
	numChars : number of characters to use
```
Ex:
```java
char chars[] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'};
String s = new String(chars, 2, 3);
// s = "cde"
```

3. Construct String objects that contains the same character sequence as another String object.
```
String(String strObj);
```

Ex: 
```java
char chars[] = {'J','a','v','a'};
String s1 = new String(char);
String s1 = new String(s1);

System.out.println(s1); //Java
System.out.println(s2); //Java
```

4. Construct Strings using a byte array
```
String(byte byteArr[]);
String(byte byteArr[], int startIndex, int numChars);
```
Java's char type uses 16 bit to represent the basic Unicode character set. But the internet uses 8-bit bytes to construct strings from the ASCII character set. Since the 8-bit ASCII strings are common, the String class provide this constructors to initialize a string using a byte array.
Ex:
```java
byte ascii[] = {65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70};
String s1 = new String(ascii);
Stirng s1 - new String(ascii, 2, 3);

System.out.println(s1); // ABCDEF
System.out.println(s1); // CDE
```

5. Construct a String using extended Unicode character set. 
```
String(int codePoints[], int startIndex, int numChars);
```
	codePoints[] : an array of Unicode code points
	startIndex : beginning of the subrange
	numChars : number of characters

### String Length
length = number of characters that it contains
**length()** method is used for get the length of an array.
```
int length();
```

Ex:
```java
char chars[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
String str = new String(chars);
System.out.println(str.length()); // 3
```

### Special string operations
These operations including the 
	1. automatic creation of new String instances from string literals,
	2. Concatenation of multiple String objects by use of "+" operator
	3. conversion of other data types to a string representation
There are explicit methods available to perform all of these functions, but java does them automatically. 

### String Literals
String literals are sequences of characters within double quotes(" ") that represent string values in java code. 
For each string literal, java automatically constructs a String object. 
You can use a string literal to initialize a String object. 
So that, you can use string literal any place you can use String object. And you can call methods directly on a quoted string literals as if it were an object reference. 
Ex:
```java
char chars[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'}; // character array
String s1 = new String(chars); 
String s2 = "abc"; // String literal - automatically converts to a string object
s2.length(); // 3
```

### String concatenation
"+" operator can be used to concatenate two strings. 
This is the only situation which java allows operators to be applied on Strings. 
Ex:
```java
String age = "9";
String str = "He is " + age + " years old.";
System.out.println(str);
// He is 9 years old.
```

- You can concatenate strings with other types of data. 
Ex:
```java
int age = 9; // integer
String str = "He is " + age + " years old.";
System.out.println(str);
// He is 9 years old.
```
Here, int value in age is automatically converted into its string representation within a String object. The compiler will do this to any other operand ==whenever the other operand of the '+' is an instance of String.== 

Ex:
```java
String str1 = "Four: " + 2 + 2;
System.out.println(str1); // 22
// integer to String conversion occurs before the addition happens.

String str2 = "Four: " + (2+2);
System.out.println(str2); // 4
// using parantheses, you let complete the addition and then conversion happens later. 
```

### String conversion and toString()
When java converts data into its string representation during concatenation, it does so by calling one of the overloaded version of the string conversion method **valueOf()** defined by **String.valueOf()**. 

- For the primitive types **valueOf()** returns a string that contains the human readable form of the value. (valueOf() is defined by the String class.)
- For objects, **valueOf()** call the **toString()** method on the object to do the same work. (toString() is defined by the Object class.)

Every class implements **toString()** because it's defined by the 'Object class'.
The default implementation of **toString()** is seldom sufficient. For most important classes that you create, you will want to override **toString()** and provide your own string representation.

General form,
```java
String toString()
```

By overriding **toString()** in your own classes, you allow them to be fully integrated into Java's programming environment, so it can be used in 
1. print()
2. println()
3. concatenation expressions.

Ex:
```java
class Box {
	double width;
	double height;
	double depth;
	Box(double w, double h, double d) {
		width = w;
		height = h;
		depth = d;
	}
	// override the toSting() method in the Box class
	public String toString() {
		return "Dimensions are "+width+" by "+depth+" by "+height+"."; 
	}
}

class toStringDemo {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		// creating a Box object
		Box boxObj = new Box(10, 12, 14);
		// use concatenation on the Box object
		String concatStr = "Box object: " + b;

		// now every time an string output required by the program regarding a Box object, overridden toSting() method it getting called, not the regular toString() method defined in the Object class.
		System.out.println(boxObj);
		System.out.println(concatStr);
	}
}
```
```
Output: 
	Dimensions are 10.0 by 12.0 by 14.0
	Box object: Dimensions are 10.0 by 12.0 by 14.0
```
