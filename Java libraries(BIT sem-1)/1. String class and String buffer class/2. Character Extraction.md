**String** class provide several way to extract characters from a String object. 
Many of the string methods employ an index into the string for their operation, like arrays. (Indexes begins at 0)

#### 1. charAt()
Used to extract a single character from a String. 
General form,
```java
char charAt(int index)
```
index: nonnegative and specify the location within the string.
Ex:
```java
char ch;
ch = "abc".charAt(1); // returns 'b'
```

#### 2. getChars()
Used to extract more than one characters at a time. 
General form,
```java
void getChars(int sourceStart, int sourceEnd, char target[], int targetStart)
```
```
sourceStart : index of the begining of the substring
sourceEnd : index that is one past the end of the desired substring
target[] : array that will recieve the characters
targetStart : the index within 'target' at which substring will be copied
```
- Substring contains the characters from **sourceStart** through **sourceEnd-1**.
- Make sure the **target** array is large enough to hold the number of characters in the specified substring.

Ex:
```java
class getCharsDemo{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		String str = "This is a demo of the getChars method";
		int start = 10;
		int end = 14;
		char buff[] = new char[end - start];

		str.getChars(start, end, buff, 0)
		System.out.println(buff);
	}
}
```
```
Output:
	demo

_   d e  m  o  _
09 10 11 12 13 14

str contains characters from 'start' to 'end-1'
```

#### 3. getBytes()
An alternative to **getChars()** method and it stores characters in an array of bytes. This method uses the default character-to-byte conversions provided by the platform. 
Simplest form, (other forms are available too)
```java
byte[] getBytes()
```
- Useful when exporting a String value into an environment that does not support 16-bit Unicode characters. (most internet protocols and text files uses 8-bits ASCII for all text interchange.)

#### 4. toCharArray()
The easiest wat to convert all the characters in a String object into a character array. 
Returns an array of characters for the entire string. 
General form,
```java
char[] toCharArray()
```
- Similar to **getChars()** method.
