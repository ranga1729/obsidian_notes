same as `toString()` method.
Returns a human readable String form of any data type. 

`valueOf()` is a ==static== method overloaded in **String class** for all of Java's built in types so that each type can be converted properly into a string. 

`valueOf()` also overloaded in **Object class** so any object of any type you create can also be converted into a sting. 

**Useful when data is needed concatenation operations.**

Ex:
```java
int intInt = 30;
double doubleDouble = 4.56789;
String str = "91";

//get a string representation of intNum integer value.
String strInt = String.valueOf(intInt);
//now 'strInt' can be used to concatenation operations.
System.out.println(strInt);
System.out.println(strInt + s);

String strDouble = String.valueOf(doubleDouble);
//now 'sstrDouble' can be used to concatenation operations.
System.out.println(strDouble);
System.out,println(str + strDouble);
```
```
Output:
	30
	3091
	4.56789
	914.56789
```

All of the simple types converted into their common String representation while any object that you pass to `valueOf()` will return the result of a call to the **Object**'s `toString()` method. In fact you could just call `toString()` directly and get the same result. 

- a special version of `valueOf()` allows you to specify a subset of a 'char' array. General form is,
```java
static String valueOf(char chars[], int startIndex, int numChars)
```
```
chars[] : array that holds the characters
startIndex : index where the desired substring begins
numChars : number of characters/length of the substring
```
