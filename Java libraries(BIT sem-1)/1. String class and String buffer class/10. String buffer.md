Regular Strings are fixed-length and immutable character sequences. 

**StringBuffer** supports modifiable string. 
These are growable and writable character sequences. 
Characters and substrings can be added in the middle or appended to the end. Buffer will automatically grow to make room for such additions and StringBuffers often has more characters pre-allocated than are actually needed. to allow room for growth.

StringBuffer defines 4 constructors, 
1. Default constructor
Reserves room for 16 characters without reallocation.
```java
StringBuffer()
```

2.  Explicitly sets the size of the buffer.
```java
StringBuffer(int size)
```

3. Accepts a String argument that sets the initial content of the StringBuffer object and reserves room for 16 more characters without re-allocation.
```java
StringBuffer(String str)
```

4. Creates and object that contains the character sequence contained in `chars` and reserves room for 16 more characters.
```java
StringBuffer(CharSequence chars)
```

- **StringBuffer** allocates room for 16 additional characters when no specific buffer is requested, because re-allocation is a costly process in terms of time. Also, frequent re-allocations can fragment memory. By allocating few extra character, StringBuffer reduces the number of re-allocations that take place. 

#### length() 
Returns the current length of a StringBuffer. 
General form,
```java
int length()
```
#### capacity()
Returns the total allocated capacity of a StringBuffer.
General form,
```java
int capacity()
```

Ex:
```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
System.out.println("Buffer: "+ sb);
System.out.println("Length: "+ sb.length());
System.out.println("Capacity: "+ sb.capacity());
```
```
Output:
	Buffer: Hello
	Length: 5
	Capacity: 21
(16+5 = 21)
```

#### ensureCapacity()
Used to pre-allocate room for a certain number of characters after a StringBuffer has been constructed. 
- General form,
```java
void ensureCapacity(int minCapacity)
```
```
minCapacity: specifies the minimum size of the buffer. 
(A buffer larger than minCapacity may be allocated for reasons of efficiency.)
```

#### setLength()
To set the length of the string within a StringBuffer object. 
- General form,
```java
void setLength(int len)
```
```
len: specifies the length of the string 
```
- This `len` value must be non-negative.
- When you increases the size of the string, null characters are added to the end. 
- If you call `setLength()` with a value less than the current value returned by `length()`, then the characters stored beyond the new length will be lost.
- Can be used to shorten a StringBuffer.

#### charAt()
Used to obtain a single character in the StringBuffer.
General form,
```java
char charAt(int index)
```

#### setCharAt()
Set the value of a character within a StringBuffer.
General form,
```java
void setCharAt(int index, char ch)
```

- For `charAt()` & `setCharAt()`, `index` must be non-negative and must not specify a location beyond the end of the string. 

Ex:
```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
System.out.println("Buffer before: " + sb);
System.out.println("charAt(1) before: " + sb.charAt(1));

sb.setCharArt(1, 'i');
sb.setLength(2);
System.out.println("Buffer after: " + sb);
System.out.println("charAt(1) after: " + sb.charAt(1));
```
```
Output:
	Buffer before: Hello
	charAt(1): e
	Buffer after: Hi
	charAt(1): i
```

#### getChars()
used to copy a substring of a StringBuffer into an array.
- General form,
```java
void getChars(int indexStart, int indexEnd, char target[], int targetStart)
```
```
indexStart: index of the begining of the substring
indexEnd-1: index of the end of the substring
target[]: arrya that will recieve the characters
targetStart: the index within the target at which the substring will be copied is passed in targetStart. 
```
- Care must be taken to assure that the target is large enough to hold the number of characters in the specified substring. 

#### append()
Concatenates the string representation of any other type of data to the end of the invoking StringBuffer object. 
Overloaded version,
```java
StringBuffer append(String str)
StringBuffer append(int num)
StringBuffer append(Object obj)
```
- The string representation of each parameter is obtained, often by calling `String.valueOf()`. The result if appended to the current StringBuffer object.
- This method can be used to chain several appends together. 
Ex:
```java
String str;
int a = 42;
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(40);

str = sb.append("a = ").append(a).append("!").toString();
```
```
Output:
	a = 42!
```

#### insert()
Insert one string into another string. 
The return string is then inserted into a **StringBuffer** object.
This method is overloaded to accept values of all the primitive types.
```java
StringBuffer insert(int index, String str)
StringBuffer insert(int index, char ch)
StringBuffer insert(int index, Object obj)
```
```
index : the index at ehich point the string will be inserted into the invoking StringBuffer object. 
```

Ex:
```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("I Java!");
sb.insert(2, "like ")
```
```
Output:
	I like Java!
```

#### reverse()
Used to reverse the character sequence within a StringBuffer object. 
General form,
```java
StringBuffer reverse()
```
Returns the reversed StringBuffer object.
Ex:
```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("abcdef");
System.out.println(sb);
sb.reverse();
System.out.println(sb)
```
```
Output:
	abcdef
	fedcba
```

#### delete()
Deletes a sequence of characters from the invoking object.
General form,
```java
StringBuffer delete(int startIndex, int endIndex)
```
```
startIndex: index of the first character to remove
endIndex: index one past the last character to remove
```
- substring deleted runs from `startIndex` to `endIndex-1`.
#### deleteCharAt()
Deletes a character at a specific location within a StringBuffer object.
General form,
```java
StringBuffer delete(int index)
```
```
index: index of the character to be removed.
```

Ex:
```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("ABCDEFGHIJKL");

sb.delete(3, 7);
System.out.println("After delete(4, 7): " + sb);

sb.deleteChartAt(0);
System.out.println("After deleteCharAt(0): " + sb);
```
```
Output:
	After delete(4, 7): ABCHIJKL
	After deleteCharAt(0): BCHIJKL
```

#### substring()
Obtain a portion of a StringBuffer object.
- General forms,
1. Returns the substring start at `startIndex` and runs to the end of the invoking StringBuffer object. 
```java
String substring(int startIndex)
```
2. Returns the substring start at `startIndex` and runs to the `endIndex-1`
```java
String substring(int startIndex, int endIndex)
```

#### indexOf()
Search the invoking StringBuffer for the first occurrence of a given string.
General form,
```java
int indexOf(String str)
```
```
str: the string which is looking for in the invoking StringBuffer
```

#### lastIndexOf()
Search the invoking StringBuffer for the last occurrence of a given string.
General form,
```java
int lastIndexOf(String str)
```
```
str: the string which is looking for in the invoking StringBuffer
```

Ex:
```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("one two one");
int i = sb.indexOf("one");
System.out.println("i :" + i);
i = sb.lastIndexOf("one");
System.out.println("i :" + i);
```
```
Output
	i : 0
	i : 8
```
