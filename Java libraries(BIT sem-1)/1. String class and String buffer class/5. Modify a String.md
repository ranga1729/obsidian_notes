Because String objects are ==immutable==, whenever you wan to modify a String, you must either copy it into a **StringBuffer** or **StringBuilder** or use String method that construct a new copy of the string with your modifications complete. 

#### substring()
Extract a substring from a string object. 
Two forms,
```java
String substring(int startIndex)
//begins at startIndex and runs to the end of the invoking string.

String substring(int startIndex, int endIndex)
//returning a substring contains all the characters from the beginning index up to the endIndex, but not including the endIndex.
```
```
startIndex : index which the substring will begin.
endIndex : stopping point. 
```

Ex:
```java
class StringReplace{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		String org = "This is a test. This is, too";
		String search = "is";
		String replace = "was";

		String result = ""; // an empty string
		int i;

		do{
			System.out.println(org);
			i = org.indexOf(search);
			if(i != -1){
				result = org.substring(0, i);
				reuslt = result + replace;
				result = result + org.(i, search.length);
				org = result;
			}
		} while(i != -1);
	}
}
```
```
output:
	This is a test. This is, too.
	Thwas is a test. This is, too.
	Thwas was a test. This is, too.
	Thwas was a test. Thwas is, too.
	Thwas was a test. Thwas was, too.
```

#### concat()
Concatenate two strings. (same as what + operator does to two strings.)
```java
String concat(String str)
```
This method creates a new object that contains the invoking string with the content of 'str' appended to the end.

Ex:
```java
String s1 = "one";
String s2 = s1.concat("Two") // String s2=s1+"Two";
System.out.println(s2); //oneTwo
```

#### replace()
Has two forms.
1. Replace all occurrences of one character in invoking string with another character. The resulting string is returned.
```java
String replace(char original, char replacement) 
```
```
original: character to be replaced
replacement: the character which is going to replace the 'original'
```
Ex:
```java
String newStr = "Globalization".replace('o','K');
//"GlKbalizKtion"
```

2. Replaces a character sequence with another.
```java
String replace(CharSequence original, CharSequence replacement)
```

#### trim()
Returns a copy of the invoking string after removing any leading(front) and trailing(back) whitespaces.
General form,
```java
String trim()
```
Ex:
```java
String str = "   Hello World.   ".trim();
```
This method removes whitespaces only in the front and the back of the invoking string, not the whitespaces in the middle of the string.
This method is useful when processing user inputs.(If the user have entered leading or trailing whitespaces inadvertently.)
