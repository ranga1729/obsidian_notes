- **StringBuilder** is similar to **StringBuffer** except it's not synchronized, which means that it is not thread-safe.
- The advantage of **StringBuilder** is faster performance.
- In case which a mutable string will be accessed by multiple threads, and no external synchronization is employed, you must use **StringBuffer** rather than **StringBuilder**.
