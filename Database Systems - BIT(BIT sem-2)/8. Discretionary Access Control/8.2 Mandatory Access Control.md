In many applications, an additional security policy is needed to classifies data and users based on security classes. 
This '/mandatory Access Control' is typically combined with discretionary access control mechanisms.

Typical security classes,
1. Top secrete(TS)
2. Secrete(S)
3. Confidential(C)
4. Unclassified(U)
*TS* is the highest level and *U* s the lowest :  $TS \ge S \ge C \ge U$

A multilevel relation schema R with n attributes would be represented as $R(A_{1,}C_{1,}, A_{2,}C_{2,}...,A_{n,}C_{n,} TC)$
Each $C_i$ represents the classification attributes associated with attribute $A_i$

A multilevel relation will appear to contain different data to subjects(users) with different clearance levels. 
In some cases, it is necessary to store two or more tuples at different classification levels with the same value for the apparent key.
This leads to the concept of *polyinstantiation* where several tuples can have the same apparent key value but have different attribute values for users at different classification levels. 

> [!NOTE] Polyinstantiation
> Polyinstantiation is a database technique that allows the database to contain different tuples with the same key but with different classifications.
> Polyinstantiation occurs because of mandatory policy
