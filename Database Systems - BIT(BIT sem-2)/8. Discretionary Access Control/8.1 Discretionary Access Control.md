Governs the access of users to information on the basis of user's identity and predefined discretionary rules defined by the security administrator.

**Method** : Granting and Revoking privileges. 

Types of discretionary privileges,
1. The account level : DBA specifies the particular privileges that each account holds(independently of the relation in the database).
	Privileges can include are,
		CREATE SCHEMA or CREATE TABLE
		CREATE VIEW
		ALTER
		DROP
		MODIFY(INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE)
		SELECT
2. The relation(or table) level : DBA can control the privilege to access each individual relation(table) or view in the database.
	Following privileges can be set on each relation/view,
		SELECT
		MODIFY(INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE)
		REFERENCES(Reference another relation when specifying integrity constraint.)

MODIFY privilege has 3 options,
- INSERT - allows insert new data. But no modifications. Insertion will be for specified attributes and the remaining will take default or NULL.
- UPDATE - Allows modification of data, but no deletion. Modification can be for the specified attributes.
- DELETE - allow deletion of data.

REFERENCE privilege on relation(table) R gives the account the capability to reference relation R when specifying integrity constraints. The privilege can also be restricted to specific attributes of R.

In SQL2, the DBA can assign owner to a whole schema, associating the appropriate authorization with CREATE SCHEMA command. This owner account holder can can pass privileges on any of the owned relation to other users. 
Ex:
	User Account A1 can create tables tables under the EXAMPLE schema.
	A1 creates two base tables called EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT.
	A1 is the owner of these two relations(tables) hence all the relation privileges on each of them.

Granting privileges,
Syntax,
```postgresql
GRANT <privilege_list>
ON <relation/view_list>
TO <user_list>
```
Ex:
```mysql
GRANT UPDATE(Designation)
ON Employee
TO A2, A3;

GRANT SELECT, INSERT
ON Employee
TO A2;
```
**Propagation of Privileges,**
When the owner of a relation(table) grants privileges to some other account on that relation, the privileges can be given with or without the "GRANT" options itself. 
If the GRANT option is given, the new privileged account also able to grant privileges to other accounts on that specific table. 
```mysql
GRANT SELECT ON Employee, Department TO B WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

A complete Examples of granting access on views,
- A1 has to create a view,
```mysql
CREATE VIEW A4EMPLOYEE AS
SELECT NAME, BDATE, ADDRESS 
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE DNO=5;
```
- Then A1 grant SELECT privilege to A4 on the view A4EMPLOYEE.
```mysql
GRANT SELECT ON A4EMPLOYEE TO A4 WITH GRANT OPTION;
```
- A1 wants to allows A4 to update only the SALARY attribute of EMPLOYEE
```mysql
GRANT UPDATE ON EMPLOYEE(SALARY) TO A4;
```

Revoking privileges,
Syntax,
```mysql
REVOKE <privilege_list>
ON <relation/view_list>
FROM <user_list>
```
Ex:
```mysql
REVOKE SELECT
ON Employee
FROM A2;

REVOKE UPDATE(Designation)
ON Employee
FROM A2;
```
**Cascading of REVOKE,**
 The revocation of a privilege from a user may cause other users also to lose that privilege. This behavior is called *cascading of the revoke*.
 Revoke statement also specify **RESTRICT**. 

****
Example
A bank maintains a database to keep track of customer, branch, account and loan information. 
Schema,
```
Branch(BranchName, Code, City,Assets) 
Account(AcctNo, Balance, Acc-type,BranchName) 
Loan(LoanNo, Amount, Loan-type, BranchName) 
Customer(CustomerNo, Name, Address,Phone) 
C_A(CustomerNo,AcctNo) 
C_L(CustomerNo, LoanNo)
```
Privileges are granted to users of the database as in the authorization diagram.
![[Pasted image 20240621145812.png]]
1. User Sarath is able to retrieve the customer details of each customer at the Colombo branch along with his AcctNo and Balance and is able to update phone and address information of each customer. Write SQL statements to allow this.
```mysql
CREATE VIEW Sarath_View AS
SELECT Customer.CustomerNo,Customer.Name, Customer.Address, Customer.Phone Account.AcctNo, Account.Balance 
FROM customer, Account
WHERE Customer.CustomerNo = C_A.CustomerNo
AND Account.AcctNo = C_A.AcctNo
WHERE Account.BranchName='Colombo';

GRANT UPDATE ON Sarath_View(Phone, Address) TO Sarath; 
```
****
### Role Based Access Control(RBAC)
- Permissions are associated with roles and users are assigned to appropriate roles, thereby users acquires those role's permissions. 
	Roles are created for the various job functions in an organization and this simplifies management of permissions because users can be easily reassigned from one tole to another. 
- Roles can be granted new permissions. 

**Creating a role**
Syntax,
```postgresql
CREATE ROLE product_manager;
CREATE ROLE hr_manager;
```
- A layer of security can be added to roles by specifying a password.
```postgresql
CREATE ROLE overall_manager
IDENTIFIED BY manager_password;
```
- Granting privileges to roles.
```postgresql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
ON Product
TO product_manager;

GRANT CREATE USER
TO hr_manager;

GRANT product_manager, hr_manager
TO overall_manager;
```
- Granting roles to a user
	To grant a role, you must,
	1. Have been granted the role with ADMIN OPTION or
	2. Have been granted the GRANT ANY ROLE system privilege or
	3. You must have created the role
```postgresql
GRANT overall_manager TO A1;
GRANT overall_manager TO A1 WITH ADMIN OPTION;
```
- Revoking a role from a user,
```postgresql
REVOKE overall_manager FROM A1;
```
- Revoking a system privilege from a role,
```postgresql
REVOKE CREATE TABLE FOM overall_manager;
```
- Revoking a role from a role
```postgresql
REVOKE hr_manager FROM overall_manager;
```
- Dropping a role
```postgresql
DROP ROLE hr_manager;
```

- Setting a role
A user who has been granted one or more roles ahs to invoke the `SET ROLE` command to enable or disable roles for the current user session. 

If the role has a password, you must specify the password to enable the role by using the `IDENTIFIED BY` clause.

1. To activate the role 'accountant' having a password
```postgresql
SET ROLE accountant IDENTIFIED BY acct;
```
2. To disable all roles granted to you for the current session. 
```postgresql
SET ROLE NONE;
```

##### Default roles,
It is possible to provide a facility to set up a default list of roles to be activated at the time of user login.
This enables through the use of `DEFAULT ROLE` clause of the `ALTER USER` command. 

Ex: 
To make accountant role as the default active role for A1l,
```postgresql
ALTER USER A1 DEFAULT ROLE accountant; 
```
To remove all roles from A1's default active role set. 
```postgresql
ALTER USER A1 DEFAULT ROLE NONE; 
```
