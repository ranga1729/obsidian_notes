Statistical databases are used mainly to produce statistics on various populations.
The database may contain confidential data on individuals, which should be protected from user access. 
Users are permitted to retrieve statistical information on the populations, such as averages, sums, counts, maximums, minimums, and standard deviations.

> A population is a set of tuples of a relation (table) that satisfy some selection condition.

Statistical queries involve applying statistical functions to a population of tuples. Statistical users are not allowed to retrieve individual data, such as the income of a specific person. Statistical database security techniques must prohibit the retrieval of individual data.

This can be achieved by prohibiting queries that retrieve attribute values and by allowing only queries that involve statistical aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVERAGE and standard deviation.
	Such queries are sometimes called statistical queries.
It is DBMSâ€™s responsibility to ensure confidentiality of information about individuals, while still providing useful statistical summaries of data about those individuals to users.

Provision of privacy protection of users in a statistical database is paramount. In some cases it is possible to infer the values of individual tuples from a sequence statistical queries. This is particularly true when the conditions result in a population consisting of a small number of tuples
