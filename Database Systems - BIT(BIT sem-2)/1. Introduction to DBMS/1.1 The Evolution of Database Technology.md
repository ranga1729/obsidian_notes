### Components of Database System Environment
![[Pasted image 20240324113636.png]]

- Hardware
	Set of physical devices on which a database resides. Can range from a PC to a network of computers.
- Software
	Database Management System(DBMS)
	Operating System(OS)
	Application programs
	User Interface
- Data
	a representation of facts, concepts or instructions in a formalized manner suitable for communication, interpretation or processing by human beings or by automatic means. 
	Raw data means unprocessed data.(Ex: Text, colors, symbols, shapes, graphics, images, temperatures, sound, video or other facts and figures are data suitable for processing)
		Ex: Employee's name, address, date of birth, designation, department, salary, employee no. , photograph
- Procedures
	Instructions and rules that should be applied to the design and use of the database. 
- People
	Two types, 
	1. End users - clients of the database who need information from the database
	2. Practitioners - People responsible for the database system and its associated application software.(Database administrators, Database designers, Application developers)
### Information
Information can be described as processed/organized or summarized data. 
Ex: 
	Process Date of Birth -> Age
	Process Salary of all employees -> Highest paid employee
	Process all -> No of employees

### Why Database Technology ?
The need to manipulate large collection of data for frequent used data queries and reports.
Ex: Collection of information on library books 
	List of books written by a particular author
	List of books about particular subject
	Borrowing a book
	Reserving a book for borrowing

### File Based System Approach(OLD)
A file based system is a collection of application programs that perform services for the end users. Each program defines and manages it own data.

#### Data Redundancy
Data redundancy is a condition in which the same piece of data is stored in multiple places.

#### Limitations of File-Based Approach
1. Separation and isolation of data
	Each program maintain it own set of data. 
	Users of one program may be unaware of potentially useful data held by other programs.
2. Duplication of data(data redundancy)
	Same data is held by different programs. 
	Wasted space and potentially by different values and different formats for the same item.
3. Data dependance
	File structure is defined in the program code.
4. Incompatible file formats
	Programs are written in different languages and so cannot easily access each other's files.
5. Fixed queries/Proliferation of application programs
	Programs are written to satisfy particular function.
	Any new requirement need a new program.

### Database Approach
Database approach is arose in the world because file-based has some issues.
1. Definition of data was embedded in application programs, rather than being stored separately and independently. 
2. No control over access and manipulation of data beyond that imposed by application.
To address those issues, a Database Management System(DBMS) was required.
#### Database
- Database is a collection of logically related data(and a description of this data). Designed to meet the information needs of an organization. 
- System catalog or data dictionary provides description of data(metadata) to enable ==program-data independence==.
- Logically related data comprises entities, attributes and relationships of an organization's information. 
#### Database Management System(DBMS)
A software system that enables users to define, create and maintain the database and that provides controlled access to this database.

Ex: Integrated human resources database
- Employee: name, address, NIC, designation
- Payroll: hours worked, pay rate
- Benefits: insurance, pension plan
### Data Hierarchy
A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data are organized into a tree-like structure.

Ex:
Employee(EmpNo, Name, Designation, Salary, Depart)
1, De Silva, Manager, 50000, Personnel
2, Perera, Secretary, 15000, Personnel
3, Dias, Salesman, 25000, Sales

Department(Depart, Manager, Dept Addr, DeptPhone)
Personnel, De Silva, Colombo, 589123
Sales, Alwis, Kandy, 987275

Byte - A single character(letter, number, symbol) is represented using a group of bits in ASCII.
	Ex: 10101010 = letter J
Bit - The smallest unit of data
	Ex: 0 or 1
