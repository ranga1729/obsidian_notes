#### Data Dictionary
Data dictionary is a subsystem that keeps track of the definition of data items in the database which includes,
- Elementary-level data items(fields, attributes)
- Group and record-level data structure.
- Files or relational tables.
#### Meta Data
Meta data is the data that describe the properties or characteristics of other data. Some of these properties include,
- the data item
- data type
- minimum allowable value
- maximum allowable value
- rules or constraints
- brief description of each data item
Meta data allow database designers and users to understand what data exist and what the data mean.
Ex: 

| Attribute name | Data type | Length | Min  | Max    | Description     |
| -------------- | --------- | ------ | ---- | ------ | --------------- |
| EmpNo          | Number    | 9      |      |        | Employee No.    |
| Name           | Character | 30     |      |        | Employee Name   |
| Dept           | Charater  | 10     |      |        | Department No.  |
| Salary         | Number    | 8      | 5000 | 60,000 | Employee salary |
Employee No. is unique.
#### Data security and Integrity
Data Security : Protection of data against unauthorized access or corruption.
Data Integrity : Validity and accuracy of data.
#### Concurrent access
Data concurrency allows unhindered access by any number of users to the same data at the same time.
#### User-Oriented data query and reporting 
DBMS users have a query/update language to obtain the information of interest and produce reports.
#### Application development facilities
Database application development is the process of 
	analyzing real-world requirements
	designing the data and functions of the systems
	implementing the operation in the system
A programmer is able to define a set of rules using the application development facility and used to create different database applications.

### ==Three-Level ANSI/SPARC Architecture==
The three-level architecture, also known as the ANSI/SPARC architecture is a fundamental framework used to describe the structure of a database system. It separates the logical view of data from its physical storage, providing a layer of abstraction for users and applications. 
Points,
- All users should be able to access same data but have a customized view of the data. 
- A user's view is immune to changes made in other views. 
- Users should not need to know physical database storage details. 
	Ex: indexing or hashing
Levels,
1. External level(View level)
2. Conceptual level(Logical level)
3. Internal level(Physical level)
#### 1. External Level(View Level)
- Defines various user views of the database. Each view represents a specific portion of the data relevant to a particular user group or application. 
- These views include only the entities, attributes or relationships in the real-world that the user is interested in. 
- Users interact with the database through these views, without needing to know the underlying structure or storage details. 
- External views allow to,
	1. Hide unauthorized data (Ex: salary, date of birth)
	2. Provide user view (Ex: view employee name, designation, department data taken from employee and department files.)
	3. Derive new attributes (Ex: age derived from DOB or NIC)
	4. Change unit of measurement (Ex: show age in years or months)
	5. Define security levels (Ex: update access to employee file read-only to department file.)
#### 2. Conceptual Level(Logical Level)
- Conceptual level defines the overall logical structure(serves as a blueprint) of the database, independent of physical storage details.
- This schema describes the 
	entities(data objects)
	attributes(data elements)
	relationships
	constrains on the data
	Security and integrity information
- This level acts as a bridge between the external and internal level. 
#### 3. Internal Level(Physical Level)
- This level deals with the physical storage of data. It describes how data is actually stored on the storage devices including storage structures, indexing mechanisms, space allocations and access methods.
- Managed by the Operating systems(OS) under the direction of the Database Management System(DBMS).

 #### Mapping Between Levels
DBMS map/translate from one level to another.
- External - Conceptual 
	External schema is related to the conceptual schema.
- Conceptual - Internal
	Conceptual schema is related to the internal schema. 
 
 Differences Between Three Levels
![[Pasted image 20240401155650.png]]
#### Objectives of Three-Level Architecture
1. Separate the user's view of the data from its physical storage details(Separation of concerns)
	Users interacts with the database through customized views without needing to understand how the data is physically organized on storge devices. This separation simplifies data access and shields users from the complexities of physical storage.
2. Data independence
	Changes made at one level shouldn't necessarily impact the other levels.
	Ex: If the database administrator modifies the physical storage architecture(internal level), the user views(external level) and the overall logical structure(conceptual level) can remain unaffected.
	This allows for flexibility in database maintenance and upgrades.
3. Facilitates the creation of multiple user views of the same data. 
	This allows different users or applications to see the data relevant to their needs.
4. Data security
	By restricting access through user views, the architecture enhances data security. Users only see the data they are authorized to access within their views. 
5. Simplified Database Administration

#### Data Independence
Two forms.
1. Logical Data Independence
	Conceptual schema changes (Ex: addition/removal of entities) should not require changes to external schema or rewrites of application programs.
2. Physical Independence
	Internal schema changes(Ex: using different file organizations, storage structures/devices) should not require change to conceptual or external schemas.
### Database Approach
**Data Definition Language(DDL)** permits specification of data types, structures and any data constraints. All specifications are stored in the database.
**Data Manipulation Language(DML)** is the general enquiry facility(query language) of the data.

-  Controlled access to database may include,
	A security system
	An integrity system
	A concurrency control system
	A recovery control system
- A view mechanism provides users with only the data they want or need to use.
### Views
Allows each user to have his/her own view of the database.
A view is essentially some subset of the database.
Benefits of views,
1. Provide a level of security
2. Provide a mechanism to customize the appearance of the database.
### Database Languages
**Data Definition Language(DDL)** allow the database administrator to describe and name entities, attributes and relationships required for the application and any associated integrity and security constraints. 

**Data Manipulation Language(DML)** provides basic data manipulation operations on data held in the database. 
1. Non-Procedural DML
	Allows user to state what data is needed rather than how it is to be retrieved.
2. Procedural DML
	Allow users to tell system exactly how to manipulate data.

### End Users
End users are the people whose jobs require access to the database for querying, updating and generating reports. The database primarily exists for their use.
### Database Administrator(DBA)
Administering the database environment is the responsibility of the database administrator.
DBA is responsible for,
1. Authorizing access to the database.
2. Coordinating and monitoring tis use.
3. Acquiring software and hardware resources as needed.
4. Security breaches and poor system response time. 
### Capabilities of DBMS
1. Self-describing nature of a database system
	A database system contains not only the database itself, but also a complete definition or description of the database structure and constraints. 
2. Insulation between programs and data, and data abstractions
	The structure of data files is stored in the DBMS catalog separately from application programs.(program-data independence)
	User application programs can operate on the data by invoking operations through their names and arguments, regardless of how operations are implemented.(program-operation independence)
	The characteristics that allows program-data independence and program-operation independence is called data abstraction. 
3. Support of multiple views of the data
4. Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing
	Multiuser DBMS allows multiple users to access the database at the same time.

### Database Applications
Types of database,
1. Personal database
2. Workgroup database
3. Department database
4. Enterprise database
#### 1. Personal Databases
Designed to support one user with a stand alone PC. 
Ex: salesperson keeping track of this customer information with contact details
#### 2. Workgroup Databases
A relatively small team of people(less than 25) who collaborate on the same project or application.
Ex: A team of engineering designers maintain versions of the artifact that they design.
#### 3. Department Databases
A department is a functional unit of organization, Larger than a workgroup. 
Department databases are designed to support the various functions and activities of a department. 
Ex: A database that is designed to track data concerning employees, jobs, skills and job assignments. 
#### 4. Enterprise Databases
An enterprise is a one whose scope is the entire organization or enterprise. Such databases are intended to support organization-wide operations and decision making. 
n enterprise database does support information needs from many departments. 
The most important type of enterprise database today is called a **data warehouse.**
Ex: A large health care organization that operates a group of medical center's including hospitals, clinics and nursing homes.

#### Advantages of Database Approach
- Improved maintenance through program data independence
	Data descriptions are stored in a central location called the data dictionary. This property allows an organization's data to change and evolve(within limits) without changing the application program thar process the data.
- Minimal data redundancy 
	Data files are integrated into a single, logical structure. 
	Each primary fact is recorded in only one place in the database. 
	Ex: Employee data is not redundant with payroll data.
- Improved data consistency
	By eliminating data redundancy, we greatly reduce the opportunity for inconsistencies. Since that, updating data values is greatly simplified and storage space is not get wasted.
- Improved data sharing
	A database is designed as a shared corporate resource and can be shared by all authorized users. In this way more users share more of the data. New application can also be built on the existing data.
- Increased productivity
	DBMS provides many of standard functions(Ex: forms, report generations) that programmer would normally have to write in a file-based application DBMS. 
	Then programmer can concentrate on the specific functions required for the new application, without having to worry about design or low-level implementation details. 
- Enforcement for standard
	Database administration functions should be granted single-point authority and responsibility for establishing and enforcing data standards including naming conventions, data quality standards and uniform procedures for accessing, updating and protecting data.
- Improved data integrity
	Constraints can be applied to the database which are consistency rules that the database is not permitted to violate.
	Ex: A member of staff's salary can not be greater than 60,000.
- Improved data accessibility and responsiveness
	English-like query language SQL and query tools such as 'Query-By-Example' provide facilities to end user, without programing experience, retrieve and display data.
- Improved security
	DBMS can be used to enforce database security steps such as usernames and passwords to identify people authorized to use the database. The access that the authorized user is allowed on the data can also be restricted by the operation types(retrieval, delete, update, insert).
- Increased concurrency
	Many DBMS allow users to undertake simultaneous operations on the database. The DBMS implements a concurrency control mechanism that prevents database accesses from interfering with one another. 
#### Disadvantages of DBMS
- Complexity
- Size
- Cost of DBMS
- Additional hardware costs
- Cost of conversion
- Performance
- Higher impact of a failure
