### Selection
Also known as **Restrictions**.
- **SELECT** operation on the relation R based on a selection condition is denoted by,
	$\LARGE{\sigma_{<selection condition>}(R)}$
- Result of a SELECT operation is a subset of the tuples from relation $R$ that satisfies the selection condition.
	Select creates a horizontal partition of the relation, filtering out tuples that does not satisfy the condition.
	The resulting relation has the same attributes as $R$(has the same degree).
	The resulting relation contains the same or less number of tuples that R.
- Selection condition is a boolean expression specified on the attributes of the relation. 
- The fraction of tuples selected by selection condition is referred to as the **selectivity** of the condition.
	Selectivity = $\large{|\sigma_{C}(R)|\hspace{2mm} / \hspace{2mm} |R|}$

Ex: Retrieve all employees who either work in department 4 and make over $25,000 per year, or work in department 5 and make over $30,000
$$
\begin{flalign}
	\large{\sigma_{(Dno=4 \hspace{2mm} AND \hspace{2mm} Salary>25000) \hspace{2mm} OR \hspace{2mm} (Dno=5 \hspace{2mm} AND \hspace{2mm} Salary>30000)}(EMPLOYEE)}
\end{flalign}
$$
- SELECT is a unary operation.
- SELECT operation is commutative.
	(The result of applies same set of SELECTs in any order gives the same result.)
	$\large{\sigma_{<cond1>}(\sigma_{<cond2>}(R))  = \sigma_{<cond2>}(\sigma_{<cond1>}(R))}$
- A sequence of SELECTs can be combined into a single SELECT operation with a conjunctive **AND** condition.
	Ex:
	$\large{\sigma_{<C1>}(\sigma_{<C2>}(...(\sigma_{<Cn>}(R))...))  = \sigma_{<C1>AND<C2>AND...<Cn>}(R))}$

### Projection
- PROJECT operation on the relation $R$ based on a list of attributes is denoted by,
	$\LARGE{\pi_{<attribute \hspace{2mm} list>}(R)}$
	This operation project the relation over only the attributes specified in the $<attribute \hspace{2mm} list>$.
	The result contain a set of tuples corresponding to the tuples in R extracting only the values of specified attributes and eliminating duplicates.
	Project creates a vertical partition of the relation, filtering out attributes for the tuples that are not specified in the projection list. 
- The degree of the resulting relation is equal to the number of attributes specified in $<attribute \hspace{2mm} list>$.
- The result of the project operation is a set of distinct tuples. 
	The project operation removes any duplicate tuples.
	The resulting relation contains the same or less number of tuples that R. 
- PROJECT is a unary operation.
- PROJECT operation is not commutative.
- A sequence of PROJECTs can be re-written as follows,
$$
\begin{flalign}
&\large{\pi_{<list1>}(\pi_{<list2>}(...(\pi_{listn})...)) = \pi_{<list1>}(R)}
\end{flalign}
$$

### JOIN
- Join operation between relation $R$ and $S$ is denoted by $\large{R \bowtie_{<join-condition>} S}$ 
	The operation is generate a set of tuples by combining tuples from two related relations R and S into a single tuples where the two tuples satisfies the join condition.
	JOIN operation allows to process relationships among relations.
- The goin operation $R(A_1,A_2,...A_{n)} \bowtie_{C} S(B_1,B_2,...B_m)$ produces a new relation $Q(A_1,A_2,...A_n,B_1,B_2,...B_m)$ 
	Degree of $Q$ is equal to the sum of the degree values of $R$ and $S$.
	If the number of tuples in $R$ and $S$ are $n_R$ and $n_S$ respectively; the number of tuples in $Q$, $n_{Q} \leqslant (n_{R}\times n_S)$ 

Ex: Retrieve the name of the manager of each department.
$$
\begin{flalign}
&\large{DEPT\_{MGR} \leftarrow DEPARTMENT_{Mgr\_emp\_no=Emp\_no}\bowtie EMPLOYEE}\\
&\large{RESULT \leftarrow \pi_{Dname,Lname,Fname}(DEPT\_MGR)}
\end{flalign}
$$

- JOIN operation can be specified by the basic relational algebra operations,
	$\large{R \bowtie_{C} S = \alpha_{C}(R \times S)}$ 
Ex:
$$
\begin{flalign}
&\large{EMP\_DEPS\leftarrow EMPNAMES \times DEPS}\\
&\large{DEP\_INFO\leftarrow \alpha_{Emp\_no=D\_Emp\_no}(EMP\_DEPS)}\\
&\large{DEP\_{INFO}\leftarrow EMPNAMES \bowtie_{Emp\_no=D\_Emp\_no}DEPS}
\end{flalign}
$$
### Theta JOIN
A theta join is a join operation with a join condition of the form,
$$
\begin{flalign}
&\large{<cond> AND <cond> AND...AND<cond>}
\end{flalign}
$$
and each $<cond>$ is of the form $A_{i} \circleddash B_i$ where $\circleddash$ is one of the comparison operator $\lbrace =,\hspace{1mm}<,\hspace{1mm}\le,\hspace{1mm} >,\hspace{1mm} \ge,\hspace{1mm} \not= \rbrace$     

- Tuples whose join attributes are NULL or for which the join condition is FALSE do not appear in the result. 
Ex: Imagine two tables, `Customers` and `Orders`, where you want to find orders placed by customers whose age is greater than 25.
	$\LARGE{Customers \bowtie_{(Customer.age>25)}Orders}$

### Equiljoin
- A equiljoin is a join operation involves a join condition with equality comparison only. 
	For the general form of the join condition,
	${<cond> AND <cond> AND...AND<cond>}$ 
	each $<cond>$ us of the form $A_{i}= B_i$
The result of an EQUILJOIN always contains one or more pairs of attributes (for attribute pairs used in the join condition) that have identical values in every tuples. 

Ex: Combine each PROJECT tuple with the DEPARTMENT tuple that controls the project. Assuming the attribute name of the department number in PROJECT and DEPARTMENT are Dnum and Dnumber respectively. 
	$\large{RESULT \leftarrow PROJECT \bowtie_{Dnum=Dnumber}DEPARTMENT}$

### Natural Join
Denoted by $*$. 
Natural join is performed only on a pair of relations with the join attributes have the same name in the two relations. 
This operation is used to get rid if the second attribute in an equiljoin condition. 
All the attribute pairs with the same name will be considered as join attributes so it's not required to explicitly specify the join condition using comparison operators. The system automatically identifies columns with the same name and data type in both tables and uses those for joining.

Ex: Combine each PROJECT tuple with the DEPARTMENT tuple that controls the project. 
Since the attribute name for department number in PROJECT and DEPARTMENT are different, we can rename the attributes in DEPARTMENT and before applying Natural join operation.
	$RESULT \leftarrow PROJECT* \rho_{(Dname,Dnum,...)}DEPARTMENT$
	OR
	$DEPT \leftarrow \rho_{(Dname, Dnum,...)}DEPARTMENT$
	$RESULT \leftarrow PROJECT * DEPT$  

### Outer Join
Outer join operation includes tuples in the result that do not have matching values in the join attribute. 
$R \bowtie S$ 
(Left) Outer join is join which tuples from R that do not have matching values for the common attributes of S are also included in result relation.

Ex: Retrieve names of mangers of the departments and names of departments that they manage. 
$$
\begin{flalign}
&\large{Temp \leftarrow Employee \bowtie_{(emp\_no=mgr\_emp\_no)}Department}\\
&\large{Result \leftarrow \pi_{Fname, Lname,Dname}(Temp)}
\end{flalign}
$$
### Division
Division between two relations $R$ and $S$ is denoted by $R\div S$ 
Division operation results in a relation over the attributes $C$ that consist of set of tuples from $R$ that match combination of every tuple in $S$.

Ex: Retrieve the names of employees who work on all projects that 'Sunil Silva' works on.
$$
\begin{flalign}
&\large{Sunil \leftarrow \sigma_{Fname='Sunil' AND Lname='Silva'}(Employee)}\\
&\large{Sunil\_Pnos \leftarrow \pi_{Pno}(Works\_on\bowtie_{e\_id=emp\_id}Sunil)}\\
&\large{Empid\_Pnos \leftarrow \pi_{E\_id,Pno}(Works\_on)}\\
&\large{Empids \leftarrow Empid\_{Pnos} \div Sunil\_Pnos}\\
&\large{RESULT \leftarrow \pi_{Fname,Lname}(Empid*Employee)}\\
\end{flalign}
$$
### Minimal Set of RA Operations
There are 5 basic operations in relational algebra,
1. Selection
2. Projection
3. Cartesian product
4. Union
5. Set difference

Any other operation such as join, intersection and division can be expresses in terms of these basic operations.

### Simple and Complex Queries
