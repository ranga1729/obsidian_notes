### Intro
A database design and the creation of an entity relationship diagram (ERD) is an important part of the application development lifecycle. 
==An accurate and up to date data model can serve as an important reference tool for Database Administrators(DBAs), developers and other members of a JAD(joint application development) team.== 
The central theme behind the database design is to "measure twice, cut once."

### Data Modeling
==Data model is a conceptual representation of Data object, the associations between different data objects and the rules.== A data model represents a business' data and act as a blueprint and foundation of a database.
The data model and subsequently the database should be designed to be extensible and expandable. Therefore, understanding the business environment and the initial reason for the database is essential.  In that case, **data modeling helps to visualize the representation of data, enforces business rules, regulatory compliances and government policies on the data.**
==Data model emphasize on what data is needed and how it should be organized instead of what operations need to be performed on the data.== 

There are two types of data model techniques,
1. **Entity Relationship(ER) Model**
2. **UML(Unified Modeling Language)**
#### Goals of Data Modeling
- Ensures that all data objects required by the database are accurately represented. 
- Helps design the database at the conceptual, physical and logical levels.
- Data model helps to define relational tables, primary and foreign keys and stored procedures. 
- It provides the base data and can be used by database developers to create a physical database.
- Helpful to identify missing and redundant data. 

Initially creation of data model is labor an time consuming, in the long run, it makes the IT infrastructure upgrade and maintenance cheaper and faster. 
A poor database design can cripple and application, producing problems with redundancy, inaccuracy, consistency and concurrency of your data.
#### Normalization
Normalization is a process that services to reduce, if not eliminate these problems with data.
Steps of normalizations,
1. Minimalization of data redundancy.
2. Minimalization of data restructuring.
3. Minimalization of I/O by reduction of transactions sizes
4. Enforcement of referential integrity.

### Types of Data modeling
(Ways of modeling)
#### Conceptual 
- Defines **what** the system contains.
- Created by: Business stakeholders and Data Architectures
- Purpose: Organize, scope and define business concepts and rules. 
#### Logical
- Defines **how** the system should be implemented regardless of the DBMS. 
- Created by: Data Architecture and Business Analysts
- Purpose: Develop technical map of rules and data structure. 
#### Physical 
- Describes **how** the system will be implemented using a specific DBMS system. 
- Created by: Database Administrator(DBA) and developers
- Purpose: Actually implement the database.
#### Types of Data models
(Outcomes of data various data modeling ways.)

1. Conceptual Data Model
	A data model representing the objects and business rules that governs the operation of an organization.
	Done by Business analysts.
	Not constrained by access requirement and technology.
2. Logical Data Model
	A set of data structures assembled following rules that describe the processing requirements(access paths) of the data in terms of a logical database model.
	Done by Data analyst.
	Not constrained by technology.
3. Physical Data Model
	A model prepared for the purpose of implementing a database that runs under the control of particular DBMS.
	Done by a Database Administrator(DBA).
	Constrained by Technology.

#### Phases of Database Design Process
1. **Requirement collection and analysis.**
2. **Create conceptual design**
3. **Create logical design**
4. **Create physical design**

#### 1. Requirement Collection and Analysis
![[Pasted image 20240416013640.png]]
Prospective database users are interviewed to understand and document their data requirements. 
Requirements are two types.
1. Database requirements
2. Functional requirements
'Data view designs'(Ex: ERD) will be created rather than 'functional view designs'(Ex: DFD).
#### 2. Create conceptual Design
![[Pasted image 20240416015543.png]]
Define high-level entities and attributes relevant to your database. 
	Ex: ER Diagram
Concise description of the data requirements of the users and includes detailed descriptions of the data, relationships and constraints. 
#### 3. Create logical Design
![[Pasted image 20240416020514.png]]
Process of mapping the database structure developed in the previous phase to a particular database model. 
	Ex: map ER model to Relational Model
This process is specific to a database model but independent of a particular DBMS(product).
#### 4. Create physical Design
![[Pasted image 20240416021741.png]]
This is the process of defining structure that enables the database to be queried in an efficient manner. 
	Ex: Index and hash file design, data partition

#### System Development Life Cycle(SDLC)
![[Pasted image 20240416120010.png]]
#### Database Development Activities,
1. Enterprise Modeling
	- Analyze current data processing.
	- Analyze the general business functions and their database needs.
	- Justify need for new data and database in support of business.
2. Conceptual Data Modeling
	- Identify scope of database requirements.
	- Analyze overall data requirements for business functions supported by database.
	- Develop preliminary conceptual data model including entities and relationships.
	- Compare preliminary conceptual data model with enterprise data model.
	- Develop detailed conceptual data model, including all entities, relationships, attributes and business rules.
	- Make conceptual data model consistent with other models of information system. 
	- Populate repository with all conceptual database specifications.
3. Logical Data Modeling
	- Analyze in detail the transactions, forms, display and inquires(data views) required by the business supported by the database. 
	- Integrate database views into conceptual data model.
	- Identify data integrity and security requirements and populate repository.
4. Physical Database Design and Creation
	- Define database to DBMS(often generated from repository.)
	- Decide on physical organization of data.
	- Design database processing programs.
5. Database Implementation
	- Code and test database processing programs.
	- Complete database documentation and training materials.
	- Install database and convert data from prior systems.
6. Database Maintenance
	- Ensure evolving information requirements are met by analyzing the database and database applications.
	- Tune database for improved performance.
	- Fix errors and recover the database and database applications.
