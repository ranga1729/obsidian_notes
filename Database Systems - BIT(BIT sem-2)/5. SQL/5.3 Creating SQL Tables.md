### SQL Schema
This concept is used to group tables and other constructs that belong to the same database application.
SQL Schema is composed of,
1. A schema name
2. Authorization identifier(To indicate user-account who own the schema)
3. Descriptors for schema elements 
	Ex: tables, constraints, views, domains

A schema is created via the **CREATE SCEHMA** statement which can include all the schema elements' definitions. 
Alternatively, the schema can be assigned a name and authorization identifier and the elements can be defined later. 
Ex:
	CREATE SCHEMA company AUTHORIZATION 'jsmith'
Make an employee table as a part of the 'company' schema later. 
	CREATE TABLE company.employee
### SQL Catalog
SQL Catalog is a named collection of schemas.
- **INFORMATION_SCHEMA** is a special schema contains all the schemas in the catalog and all the element description in these schemas.
- Integrity constraints such as referential integrity can be defined between relations only if they exist in schemas within the same catalog. 
- Schemas within the same catalog can also share certain elements, such as type and domain definitions. 

### SQL Basics
SQL languages can be divide into mainly 3 parts,
1. Data Definition Language(DDL)
2. Data Manipulation Language(DML)
3. Data Control Language(DCL)

#### Data Definition Language(DDL)
DDL defines the physical design of the database.

1. CREATE TABLE
	Adds a new table
2. DROP TABLE
	Removes an existing table.
3. ALTER TABLE
	Modifies the structure of tables.
4. CREATE VIEW
	Adds a new view
5. DROP VIEW
	Removes a view
6. CREATE INDEX
	Build an index for a column
7. DROP INDEX
	Removes an index
8. CREATE SYNONYM
	Defines an alias for a database object. 
9. DROP SYNONYM
	Removes an alias.
10. COMMENTS
	Describes a table or column.
11. LABEL
	Defines a title for a table or column.

#### Data Manipulation Language(DML)
1. SELECT : Retrieves data
2. INSERT : Adds new rows of data.
3. DELETE : Removes a row of data.
4. UPDATE : Modifies existing data.

5. DECLARE : Defines a cursor for query.
6. EXPLAIN : Describes data access for a query.
7. OPEN : Opens a cursor to retrieve query results. 
8. FETCH : Retrieves a row of query.
9. CLOSE : Close a cursor.
#### Data Control Language(DCL)
1. GRANT : Gives user access privileges
2. REVOKE : Removes privileges.
3. COMMIT : Ends current transaction.
4. ROLLBAKC : Aborts current transaction.

### ANSI/ISO SQL Keywords
ANSI/ISO specifies standard SQL keywords which can not be used to name database objects like tables, columns and users.
(Reserved words)
