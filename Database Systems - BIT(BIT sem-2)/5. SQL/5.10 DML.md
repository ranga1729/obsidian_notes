SQL allows users or application to update the database by adding new data, removing old data, modifying previously stored data and retrieve data from the database.

DML commands,
1. **SELECT**
2. **INSERT**
3. **UPDATE**
4. **DELETE**

- SQL operates on one or more tables based on set theory, not on a record at a time. 

### SELECT
- Retrieves data from one or more rows.
- Every SELECT statement produce a table of query result containing or or more columns and zero or mor rows. 
Syntax,
```mysql
SELECT {[ALL, DISTINCT]} [(select-item,),i]
FROM (table_specification)
{WHERE (search_condition)}
{GROUP BY (group_column)}
{HAVING (search_condition)}
{ORDER BY (sort_specification)}
```

#### Basic Search Conditions
1. comparisons,

| Meaning                  | Symbol         |
| ------------------------ | -------------- |
| Equal to                 | =              |
| Not equal to             | != or <> or ^= |
| Less than to             | <              |
| Less than or equal to    | <=             |
| Greater than to          | >              |
| Greater than or equal to | >=             |
2. Range (NOT BETWEEN/BETWEEN)
```mysql
...WEIGHT BETWEEN 50 AND 60
```
3. Set membership (NOT IN/IN)
```mysql
...WHERE Emp_No IN ('E1','E2','E3')
...WHERE Emp_No IN (SELECT Emp_No FROM Employee WHERE Dept_No='7')
```
4. Pattern matching (NOT LIKE/LIKE)
```mysql
WHERE Proj_Name LIKE "INFORM%"
```
5. Null Value (IS NOT NULL/IS NULL)
```mysql
...WHERE Proj_Name IS NOT NULL
```

#### Compound Search conditions
1. **AND**
2. **OR**
3. **NOT**
```mysql
...WHERE Proj_Name LIKE 'INFORM%' AND Emp_Name='DIAS'
```

#### SQL Query features
1. Summary queries
Summarize queries use SQL functions to collapse a column of data values into a single value that summarize the column.
Ex: **AVG**, **MIN**, **MAX**, **SUM**, **COUNT**

2. Sub queries
Sub queries are nested queries which uses the result of one query to help define another query. 

3. GROUP BY
A result of a previous specified clause is grouped using the group by clause. 
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240613225159.png]]
```mysql
SELECT D_no, AVG(salary) FROM employee GROUP BY D_No
```

4. HAVING
Used to filter data based on specific conditions from a query uses GROUP BY clause.
```mysql
SELECT D_No, AVG(salary) FROM Employee GROUP BY D_No HAVING AVG(salary)>12,000
```

### Equi Join
EQUI JOIN creates a JOIN for equality or matching column(s) values of the relative tables. EQUI JOIN also create JOIN by using JOIN with ON and then providing the names of the columns with their relative tables to check equality using equal sign (=).

```mysql
SELECT E.*, D.* FROM Employee E JOIN Department D ON E.D_No = D.D_No;
```
#### Inner join
```mysql
SELECT E.*, D.* FROM Employee E INNER JOIN Depsrtment D ON E.D_No = D.D_No;
```
#### Outer Joins: Left join & Right join
1. Left Outer Join
![[Pasted image 20240613230550.png]]
```mysql
SELECT E.*, D.* FROM Employee E LEFT OUTER JOIN Depsrtmnt D ON E.D_No = D.D_No;
```

2. Right Outer Join
```mysql
SELECT E.*,D.* FROM Employee E RIGHT OUTER JOIN Department D ON E.D_No=D.D_No;
```

3. Full outer join
```mysql
SELECT E.*,D.* FROM Employee E FULL RIGHT OUTER JOIN Department D ON E.D_No=D.D_No;
```

4. Natural Join
![[Pasted image 20240613231136.png]]
```mysql
SELECT * FROM Employee NATURAL JOIN Department
```
