Specifying integrity constraints,
1. PRIMARY KEY
2. UNIQUE
3. NOT NULL
4. CHECK
5. Referential Integrity Constraints(Cyclic, Self referencing, Multiple path)
6. FOREIGN KEY(CASCADE, RESTRICT, NULIFIES)
7. DEFAULT
#### Ways of stored data can be lost in many ways,
- Invalid data added to database.
- Existing data modified to a incorrect value. 
- Changes made lost dues to system error or power failure.
- Changes partially applied. 
#### Types of integrity constraints,

| Integrity                   | Description           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| NOT NULL                    | Required data         |
| CHECK                       | Validity checking     |
| PRIMARY KEY & NOT NULL      | Entity integrity.     |
| FOREIGN KEY                 | Referential integrity |
| ASSERTIN, TRIGGER           | Business rules.       |
| CASCADE, RESTRICT. SET NULL | Consistency           |
#### NULL values
Null values provides a systematic way of handling missing or inapplicable data in SQL. It is inevitable that in real-world, some data are missing, not yet known or do not apply. Null values is not a real data value.
Null values require special handling by SQL and the DBMS. Null values can be handled inconsistently by various SQL products. 
Ex: How do we handle null values in summaries like SUM, AVERAGE and etc...
### Referential Integrity
Referential integrity constraint defined the rules for associating rows with each other. (Columns which reference columns in other tables.)
Every non-null value in a foreign key must have a corresponding value in the primary key which it references.

A row can be inserted or a column updated in the dependent table only if, 
1. there is a corresponding primary key value in the parent table.
OR
2. the foreign key value is set null.

Database designers must explicitly declare the effect of a row deleted from the parent table on the dependent table,
1. **CASCADE** : Delete associated dependent child rows.
2. **RESTRICT** : (default behavior) Not allowed to delete from the parent table if there are associated dependent rows.
3. **SET NULL** : Set the value of associated dependent columns(foreign key references in the child table) to null values. 
4. **SET DEFAULT** : Similar to set null, but a specific default value is assigned to the foreign key column in the child table when the parent row is deleted. 
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee(
	Emp_No CHAR(5) NOT NULL,
	NID CHAR(10), 
	Adress VARCHAR(50),
	Salary DEC(7,2) CHECK(Salary > = 0)
	Gender CHAR(1) CHECK(Genrer IN ('M','F')),
	DOB DATE,
	First_Name CHAR(10),
	Mid_Initials CHAR(10),
	Last_Name CHAR(15) NOT NULL,
	Dept_No CHAR(2) NOT NULL,
	Supervisor CHAR(5)
	PRIMARY KEY(Emp_No),
	FOREIGN KEY(Dept_No) REFERENCES Department(Dept_No),
	FOREIGN KEY(Supervisor) REFERENCES Employee(Emp_No)
);

CREATE TABLE Dependent(
	Emp_No CHAR(4) NOT NULL,
	Depd_Name CHAR(15) NOT NULL,
	Gender CHAR(1) CHECK(Gender IN ('M','F')),
	DOB DATE NOT NULL,
	Relation VARCHAR(15),
	PRIMARY KEY(Emp_No, Depd_Name),
	FOREIGN KEY(Emp_No) REFERENCES Employee(Emp_No) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
Constraints on `Dependent` table can be shown separately like this,
```sql
CONSTRAINT Dependent_PK PRIMARY KEY(Emp_No, Depd_Name)
CONSTRAINT Dependent_FK FOREIGN KEY(Emp_No) REFERENCES Employee(Emp_No)
```

These constraints can be divide into two categories based on number of fields those constraints are focused on,
1. Single-field Constraints
	Focus on individual columns. 
Ex: 
- PRIMARY KEY
- DATA TYPE : Defines the type of data a column can hold.
- NOT NULL : Ensures the column can not contain empty values.
- UNIQUE : Guarantees that all values within a column are distinct(no duplicates).
- DEFAULT : Sets a predefined value to be automatically inserted into the column if no value is provided.
- CHECK : Define a custom expression that needs to be satisfied for a value to be valid in that column. 

2. Multiple-field Constraints
	Establish rules govern relationships between multiple fields within a table or even across different tables. 
Ex:
- PRIMARY KEY : (composite primary key) a combination of one or more columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. 
- FOREIGN KEY : Create a link between two tables. 
	`ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` clauses can be used with foreign keys to define how the child table should react to modifications in the parent table.
- CHECK(multiple fields) : expression can involve multiple columns from the same table.
