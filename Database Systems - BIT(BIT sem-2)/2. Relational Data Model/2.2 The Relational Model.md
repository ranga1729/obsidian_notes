The relational model uses a collection of **relations(tables)** to represent both data and the relationships among those data.
It organizes data into tables using rows and columns.
- **Tables(Relations)**
	Each table represents a specific entity or concept with a unique name. 
	Ex: customer, orders or products. 
- **Rows(Tuples)**
	Each row in a table is a record, representing a single instance of the entity. 
	Each row in a relation(table) are unique.
	Ex: In a customer table, a row might hold data for one customer. 
- **Columns(Attributes)**
	Vertical sections of the table. 
	They define the specific characteristics of the entity. Each column has a unique name and data type(ex: text, number, date)
	Ex: Customer name in the customer table

An entry t intersection of each row and column is atomic(single valued). There can be no multi-valued attributes in a relation.

The relational model of data has three major components,
1. Relational database objects
	Allow to define data structures.
2. Relational operators
	Allows to manipulate stored data.
3. Relational integrity constraints.
	Allows to define business rules and ensure data integrity. 

#### The formal relational model terminology
Data is represented to the user as tables. Tables are comprised of rows and fixed number of named columns.

- Columns = attributes
- data rows = tuples 
- table = relations

#### Domain
The data type describing the types of values that can appear in each column is represented by a **domain** of possible values. 
A domain(D) is a set of atomic values. Atomic values in a domain is indivisible as far as the formal relation model is concerned. 
Ex: 
	Grade_point_averages(GPA) : possible values of computed grade pint average can be real(floating-point) numbers between 0 and 4.
	Local_phone_numbers : the set of 10-digit phone numbers valid in a particular country. 
#### Cardinality
Cardinality of the domain refers to the total number of values in a domain. 
For domain D, cardinality is denoted by **|D|**
Ex:
	Domain : Days_of_week
	|days_of_week| = 7
	cardinality of the domain = 7
#### Relation scheme and Attribute
A relation is used to describe a relation and it composed of a relation name R and a list of attributes A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>.... A<sub>n</sub>.
Each attribute A<sub>i</sub> is the name of a role played by some domain D in the relation schema R.
Domain of a particular A<sub>i</sub> is denoted by **dom(A<sub>i</sub>)**

Ex: A relation storing information about university students.

- Degree of **STUDENT** relation is 7 since it has 7 attributes. 
Along with the data types of each attribute we can re-write the above relation as,

#### Attribute
It is possible for several attributes to have the same domain. The attribute names indicate different roles or interpretations for the domain. 
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240415001055.png]]
**Home_phone** and **Office_phone** attributes have the same domain "Local_phone_numbers"
	dom(Home_phone) = dom(Office_phone) = Local_phone_numbers
#### Degree of a relation
Degree of relation is the number of attributes n of its relation schema. 
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240415001709.png]]
Degree of STUDENT relation is 7.
#### Relation and Tuple
A relation is a set of tuples. Each tuple in the relation represent a particular entity. (or and object)
A single tuple or a row is called as an instance. 
- A relation of the relation schema **R(A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>.... A<sub>n</sub>)** is denoted by,
	r = {t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>3</sub>.... t<sub>m</sub>}
- Each n-tuple is an ordered list of an values.
	t = <V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>3</sub>.... V<sub>n</sub>>
	Each value V<sub>i</sub> is an element from the domain if its corresponding attribute dom(A<sub>i</sub>) or a special NULL value.
#### Cardinality of a Table
The cardinality of a table refers to the number of rows in the table.
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240415002436.png]]
Cardinality of the relation is 5 since there are only 5 tuples in the relation. 
#### Constraints
Constraints are various restrictions on data specified on a relational database.
