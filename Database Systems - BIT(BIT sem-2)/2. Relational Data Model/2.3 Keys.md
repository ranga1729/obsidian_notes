#### Superkey
Superkey is a **set of attributes(columns)** in a table that can uniquely identify each row(tuple) in the table. 
A superkey specifies a uniqueness constraints on tuples. 
Features,
1. Guarantees that each record has a distinct identity based on those attributes.(Uniqueness)
2. Superkey can encompass more attributes than necessary for unique identification. This means a superkey might contain redundant information that doesn't strictly contribute to uniqueness.
3. A single table can have several Superkeys.
#### Key(minimal superkey)
Minimal superkey means, if any attribute in the superkey K of a relation schema R is removed, the resulting subset of attributes K' is not a superkey of R anymore.
- A key has two properties,
	1. Uniqueness
	2. Minimality
A key is determined from the meaning of the attributes. When inserting new tuples to the relation above properties of the key must continue to hold. 
Ex:

- **{Ssn, Name, Age}** is a superkey. 
	Any of these attribute combinations are unique in any of these tuples.
- **{Ssn}**
	Even after dropping two other attribute values, Ssn is still unique for each tuple. 
#### Candidate key
==Candidate key is the **minimal** set of attributes(columns) in a table that can uniquely identify each row(tuple).==
(The smallest combination of columns that guarantee you will never find two rows with the same values for all those columns.)

==Superkey is also any set of attributes(columns) in a that can uniquely identify each tow, but it's not required to be minimal.== Superkey can be larger sets of attributes and might include some redundancy. 
==All candidate keys are also Superkeys.== This means any set of attributes that uniquely identifies rows qualifies as a superkey. 
==But all Superkeys are not candidate keys.== 
#### Primary Key
A primary key is **a single candidate key** chosen as the main identifier of the table. There can only be one primary key per table, and it  must identify each row without any null values.
Ex:

- For **CAR** relation, both attributes **License_number** and **Engine_serial_number** are candidate keys because they are unique their own. 
- But **License_number** has been chosen as the primary key.(Primary key is underlined.)
#### Composite Key
A composite key is a primary key that consist of more than one column. This is used when no single column is unique enough to identify a row on its own. 
Ex:

- For **DEPENDENT** relation {Essn, Dependent-name} is a composite key. 
#### Foreign Key
Basically, A foreign key is a columns or set of columns in one table that references the primary key of another table. This establish a link between the tables and helps enforces data integrity. 

In a broad way, 
A set of attributes **FK** in a relation schema **R<sub>1</sub>** is a foreign key of **R<sub>1</sub>** that references relation **R<sub>2</sub>** if it satisfies the following rules,
1. The attributes of **FK** reference(or refers to) the relation **R<sub>2</sub>**.
	The attribute in FK have the same domain(s) as the primary key attribute PK of R<sub>2</sub>.
2. The tuple **t<sub>1</sub>** in relation **r<sub>1</sub>(R<sub>1</sub>)** reference(or refers to) the tuple **t<sub>2</sub>** of relation **r<sub>2</sub>(R<sub>2</sub>)**. 
	A value of FK in a tuple t<sub>1</sub> either occurs as a value of PK for some tuple t<sub>2</sub> or is NULL.
- R<sub>1</sub> is called the referencing relation.
- R<sub>2</sub> is called referenced relation.
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240415110633.png]]
In the **EMPLOYEE** relation, the attribute **Dno** refers to the department number for which an employee works for. 
therefore **Dno** can be designated as a foreign key of **EMPLOYEE** referencing the **DEPARTMENT** relation.
![[Pasted image 20240415114105.png]]
- Referencing relation: Employee
- Referenced relation: Department
- For any tuple t<sub>1</sub> of the EMPLOYEE relation, value of Dno must match a value of the primary key of DEPARTMENT(Dnumber) in some tuple t<sub>2</sub> of the DEPARTMENT relation. 
- The value of Dno can be NULL is the employee does not belon to or not yet assigned to a department. 
#### Recursive foreign key
Recursive foreign key is a foreign key that refers to its own relation. It establishes a relationship between rows within the same table. This means column references the primary key of the same table it belongs to. 
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240415120847.png]]
The attribute **Super_ssn** in EMPLOYEE refers to the supervisor of an employee. supervisor is also another employee, represent by a tuple in the same relation. 
- Referencing relation: Employee
- Referenced relation: Employee

Ex:
Imagine a "Employee" table with columns like
	Name
	EmployeeID
	ManagerID
**EmployeeID** is the Primary key, uniquely identifying each employee. 
**ManagerID** is the recursive foreign key. It references the "EmployeeID" of another row in the same table, establishing a parent-child relationship between employees and their managers.
