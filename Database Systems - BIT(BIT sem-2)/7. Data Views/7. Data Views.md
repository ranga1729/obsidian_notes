- **Conceptual model** is a logical representation of the entire contents of the database. It's made up of base tables. Base tables store actual rows of data. 
- The **external model** represents how data is presented yo users. It's made up of **view tables.** View tables are "virtual", they do not exist in physical storage but appear to a user as if they did. Views do not occupies any storage space.

##### Characteristic of user views
- Views do not contain rows of data. Rows are derived from base table or tables from which the view is defined. 
- Views can be queried, updated, inserted into and deleted from with restrictions. 
- Integrity constraints and triggers can not be defined explicitly for views.

Syntax for creating a view,
```mysql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS (query...);
```

Ex:
```mysql
CREATE VIEW Emp_View AS
SELECT Emp_No, Emp_Name, Age, Dept_Name
FROM Emplpoyee, Department
WHERE Emp.Dept=Dept.Dept_Code and Dept.Dept_Code='SAL';
```
![[Pasted image 20240616080252.png]]
This `Emp_View` view can be queried,
```mysql
SELECT * FROM Emp_View WHERE Designation='Programmer'
```

##### Types of Views
1. Selection(Horizontal or Row)
	View a subsection of data rows in the base table.
```mysql
CREATE VIEW Sales_Employees AS
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE Dept='SAL'
```
2. Projection(Vertical or column)
	View only selected columns from the base table. 
```mysql
CREATE VIEW Emp_Info AS 
SELECT Emp_No, Emp_Name, Designation FROM Employee;
```
3. Row/Column
	View only selected columns and a subsection of data from the base table. (A combination of Selection and Projection)
```mysql
CREATE VIEW Sale_Emp_Info AS
SELECT Emp_No, Emp_Name, Designation
FROM Employee WHERE Dept='SAL';
```
4. Summarized
	Used to view a summary of data from the base table.
```mysql
CREATE VIEW Dept_Employees(Dept_Code,No_Employees) AS
SELECT Dept, COUNT(*) 
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Dept;
```
5. Derive
	View a derivation of data from the base table.
```mysql
CREATE VIEW Emp_Age_View AS
SELECT *, YEAR(CURRENT)-YEAR(DOB) AS Age
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Dept;
```
```mysql
CREATE VIEW Item_Price AS 
SELECT *, Dol_Price*90 AS Rs_Price
FROM Items;
```
6. Joined
	View data from multiple base tables.
```mysql
CREATRE VIEW Emp_Payroll AS
SELECT Emp_No, Emp_Name, Designation, Dept_Name
FROM Employee E, Department D
WHERE E.Dept=D.Dept_Code;
```

##### Benefits of having user views,
1. Security
	- Protect data from unauthorized access.
	- Each user is given permission to access the database via only a small set of views that contain specific data use is authorized to see.
2. Natural Interface
	- Provide a personalized view of database structure to different users. 
3. Query simplicity
	- Turning multiple table queries to single table queries against views by drawing data from several tables. 
	- Simplifies database access by presenting the structure of data that is most natural to the user.
4. Insulation from change
	- Maintain independence among different user views and between each user view and the physical construct. 
	- A view can present a consistent image of the database structure even is the underlying source tables are restructured. 
5. Data integrity
	- DBMS can check data to ensure that it meets specified integrity constraints.
#### User view Design considerations
User view design is driven by specific application requirements.
User view may be,
- Defined for Individual user or group of users.
- Defined to control and restrict access to specific columns and rows.
- Defined to help simplify queries, application development and maintenance. 
- Derived from base tables of other user views.

#### Limitation of user views
1. CRUD command work with limitations on views. 
	UPDATE is only work on simple views not on complex views.
2. Performance delays
	DBMS must translate queries on the view to queries against the source tables. 

##### Remove a user view
```mysql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```
Ex:
```mysql
DROP VIEW Emp_Payroll;
```
- Only remove the view.
- Data it used is not affected.

##### Update a user view
```mysql
UPDATE view_name 
SET column_name=(new values) 
WHERE matching_condition;
```

Ex:
```mysql
UPDATE work_on
SET Product_name = 'ProductY'
WHERE Emp_Code = 101;
```
- Updating a view defined on a single table without any aggregate functions can be mapped to an update on the underlying base table.
- Updating a view defined in multiple tables involving join, can be mapped to an update on the underlying on the base relations in multiple ways. 
- A view with a single defining table is updatable if the view attributes contain the primary key of the base relation, as well as all attributes with the `NOT NULL` constraint that do not have default values specified. 
- View defined on multiple tables using joins are generally not updateable.
- Views defined using grouping and aggregate functions are not updatable. 
- In SQL, the clause `WITH CHECK OPTION` must be added at the end of the view definition is a view is to be updated. It is also possible to define a view table in the `FROM` clause of an SQL query.

### Database Security
Refers to protecting the database from unauthorized or malicious use. 
Ex: 
	theft of information
	Unauthorized modification of data
	Unauthorized destruction of data.
- Views are useful of limiting user's access to various portions of the database. This simplifies system usage while promoting security.

**Types of view access,**
1. Read authorization
	Allows read only. No modifications.
2. Insert authorization
	Allows insertion of data. But no modification of data. 
	Insertion can be for some of the visible attributes and the remaining will take default or null values. 
3. Update authorization
	Allows modification of data but no deletions. 
	Modification can be for some visible attributes.
4. Delete authorization
	allows deletion of data.
A user may be assigned all, none or a combination of these types of authorization.

### SQL for Data Control,
Security and access control can be done using `GRANT` and `REVOKE` commands. 
Security and access control is based on three central objects,
1. Users
2. Database objects
3. Privileges(select, inset, update, delete, references)

**GRANT** command,
Syntax
```mysql
GRANT <privilege_list> ON <relation_or_view> TO <user_list>
```
Ex:
Granting privileges on whole view
```mysql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT 
ON Employee TO Sila;
```
Granting privileges on specific attributes(for update)
```mysql
GRANT UPDATE(Designation)
ON Employee TO silva, Dias;
```
	This allows a user to create relation that references an attribute(key) of a relation as foreign key.
```mysql
GRANT REFERENCES(Emp_No)
ON Employee TO Silva;
```

**REVOKE** Command,
Removes privileges from users in database objects,
Syntax,
```mysql
REVOKE <privilige_list>
ON <relation_or_view>
FROM <user_list>
```
Ex:
```mysql
REVOKE SELECT
ON Employee
FROM Silva;
```
```mysql
REVOKE UPDATE(Designation)
ON Employee
FROM silva;
```

##### SQL 92
The SQL-92 standard specifies a primitive authorization mechanism for the database schema. Only the owner of the schema can carry out any modification to the schema. Creating or deleting relations, adding or dropping attributes of relations, adding or dropping indices.
