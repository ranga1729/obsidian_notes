### Milestones and burndowns
Milestones can be anything like demo, beta drop. Usually milestones are sprints. 
Burndown charts can be used to measure any progress against a milestone. 

### Burndown Chart
The measurement of this chart is *'Completed story points VS Remaining story points for a sprint.'*
Over the time story points remaining should go down. That's why it's called Burndown charts.
