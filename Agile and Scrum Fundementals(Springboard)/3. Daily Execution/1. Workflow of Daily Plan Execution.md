### The Sprint
A sprint is a one iteration through the design, code, test, deploy cycle. Usually 2 weeks in duration. And every sprint should have a goal.

### Daily Execution
When the sprint is staring, each member have to take the next highest item(Because the order set based on the business importance) off the sprint backlog that they have the skills to work for and assign it to yourself.
And then you move that story into "In Progress" column in the Kanban board. 
(Now everyone knows what your are working on.)

- **Nobody should have more than one story at a time to work on.**
- When you are finished, you then create a pull request and you move that story into review QA.
	There is a way to setup pull requests on GitHub with ZenHub so that when you create a pull request it will automatically  create that pull request in Review QA.
	If you assign a story to that pull request(Git issue), it will pull the issue form "In Progress" over to "Review QA" and link them together. 
- Once my pull request is merged, I can drag that story into "Done" column.
- Then you can go back to sprint backlog, take the next highest thing off the sprint backlog and work on it.
