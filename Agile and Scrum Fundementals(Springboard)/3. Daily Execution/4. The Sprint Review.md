Sprint review meeting is the place where developers get to live demonstrate all the implemented stories. Product owner determines if stories are done based on acceptance criteria. Done stories are getting closed here. 

**Attendees,**
(Everybody)
	Product owner
	Scrum master
	Development team
	Stakeholders
	Customers(optional)

### Sprint Reviews
We should take feedback from the people who see these demonstrations during this meeting and those feedback converted into new product backlog stories.

*This is where iterative development allows the creations of products that couldn't have been specified up-front in a plan-driven approach.*

### Rejected stories
Rejected stories are the stories that product owner decided that they are not done yet according to the acceptance criteria. (Any story that are not done.)

If you remove the story without closing it, it will affect the story points.
Ex: 
	original story points 18.
	Developer built 18 points. 
	1 story with 8 points was rejected/unaccepted.
If you remove this story without closing it, it will show that you have worked on only 10 points. It's not that they didn't work up to 18 points but 8 points wasn't accepted. This will affect your current story points and it will continue to next sprint. 

To avoid this,
- Add a label to mark it unfinished or it's done.
- Then close the story.
- Open a new story with a new acceptance criteria. 
This process will keep the velocity more accurate.
