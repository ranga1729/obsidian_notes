### 1. Waterfall Development
This methodology is called 'Waterfall' because those arrows are flowing down, It's hard to swim up a waterfall.
(Ex: If you notice in the coding phase that this design is a bad design, it's really hard to redesign things.)
There is a an entrance criteria and an exit criteria to move from one phase to another.

Phases of the Waterfall development methodology,
1. Requirements: Documenting all the requirements of the customer might want in the system.
2. Design: Figuring out how to turn those requirements into a working software.
3. Code: Coding the design.(in module wise)
4. Integration: All modules come together and work together to form the software.
5. Test: Testing the software.
6. Deploy: After all testing is done, deploy the software. 

**Problems with waterfall approach,**
1. No provisions for changing requirements.
	Every phase has an entrance and an exit criteria, It's hard to go back and change things.
2. No idea if it works until the end.
	Since there's no intermediate delivery, nothing is delivered until that last step.
3. Each step ends when the next one begins.
	If previous steps got problems, they will just pass down to next phase. 
4. Mistakes found in the later stages are more expensive to fix.
5. There is a long time between software releases.(long lead times.)
6. Teams work separately, unaware of their impact on each other.
	Designers are unaware of the code,
	Coders are unaware of the integrating.
7. The people who know the least about the code are deploying it into production.
	Since deploying is the last step of the waterfall, they are the farthest away from other phases like coding. 

### 2. Extreme Programming(XP)
- Introduced in 1996 by Kent Beck.
- Based on iterative approach to software development. 
- It's tighter loops of doing work and then getting fast feedback.
- Many people recognize XP is one the first Agile methods.

**Extreme Programming values,**
1. Simplicity
	Do what you need and don't over-engineer, over-code.
	Don't deliver more than required.
2. Communication
	Everyone on the teams should know what everyone else is doing.
3. Feedback
	Having feedback loops are critical in this methodology.
4. Respect
	There's no hierarchy. Everyone can offer advices and make suggestions. 
5. Courage
	Being open and honest about what we can do and what we can't do.

### 3.Kanban
- Comes from the Japanese manufacturing systems.
- "Kanban" means "Billboard signs" and it's all about continuous flow on the manufacturing floor where these cards or notes would flow with the product from station to station, going down the line.

**Core principles of Kanban,**
1. Visualize the workflow
	If you can't see the work, you can't manage the work.
2. Limit the work in progress(WIP)
	You don't get people working on too many things at once. One person working on too many things is not good.
3. Manage and enhance the flow.
	Always looking to change and understand how can we get a better flow, a quicker flow.
4. Make policies explicit
	Everyone understand how things work, everyone understand the definition of getting something 'done'.
5. Continuously improving.
	Kanban is all about making the flow work better, understanding them, seeing them, being able to measure them and then continuously improving on how we can flow faster.
