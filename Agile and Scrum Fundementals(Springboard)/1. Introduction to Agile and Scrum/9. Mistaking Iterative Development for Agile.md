**Agile is not...**
- Agile is not a new version of a waterfall software development life cycle(SDLC), where you do legacy developments in sprints.
- Agile is not just the developers working in each sprints, it involves a cross-functional team.
	the development team in Agile are developers, testers and business analysts and may be ops people of your are doing DevOps. It's cross-functional teams, not just software engineers. 
- The Agile Manifesto does not include the term "Agile project management" and there are no projects managers in Agile. 
	Because self-managed teams assign work to themselves.
