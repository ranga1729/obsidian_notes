### Agile and Scrum
- Agile is a **philosophy** for doing work.(not prescriptive)
- Scrum is a **methodology** for doing work.(prescriptive)
	Scrum is a methodology for working in an agile fashion.

### What is Scrum ?
- Scrum is a management framework for incremental product development.
- It emphasizes small, cross-functional, self-managing teams and it provides a structure of roles, rules, meetings and artifacts.
- It also uses these 'fixed length increments' called "Sprints".
	Has a goal to build a potentially shippable product increment with each time through a sprint.

Scrum is 'Easy to learn-Difficult to master'.

### Sprint
- A sprint is one iteration through the design, code, test and deploy cycle.
- Every sprint should have a goal.
- Sprints are usually 2 weeks in duration.

### Steps in the Scrum process

- Product Backlog: This is everything you ever wanted to do with your product. (requirements and other details)
- Backlog Refinement: Backlog refinement is the process we go through the product backlog and make sure they are sprint ready. 
- Sprint Planning(planning meeting): This is the meeting we produce the sprint backlog.
- Sprint Backlog: Sprint backlog include those details about what we want to accomplish in the next sprint, in the next 2 weeks.(Smaller than the product backlog.)
After having the sprint backlog, we start our two week sprints.
everyday, team get together and do the 'daily Scrum or the daily stand-up' where everybody answer the three questions,
	1. What did you do yesterday ?
	2. What are you going to do today ?
	3. Is there anything blocking you from getting up ?
Then at the end of the two weeks sprints, you get the shippable increment. 

Since Agile development is iterative, your are going through this again and again.
In every sprint you are doing through(Software development life cycle),
	1. Design
	2. Code
	3. Test
	4. Deploy
And after every deployment, getting customer feedback is important. That feedback is the input to the next plan to go through the next cycle.
