### What's really means to work in an Agile fashion ?
- Working in small batches.
- Minimum viable product(MVP)
- Behavior driven development(BDD)
- Test driven development(TDD)
- Pair programming

### 1. Working in small batches
Ex: 
You need to mail 1000 brochures.
Step_1: Fold the brochure.
Step_2: Insert brochures into envelops.
Step_3: Seal the envelops.
Step_4: Stamp the envelop with postage.

Let's assume that we are going to do these thousand in batches of 50 and each step takes about 6 seconds to complete. So I can do 10 steps per minute. 
So it takes 5 minutes to fold 50 brochures. 
(Total 5 min)
Another 5 minutes to Insert those 50 brochures into envelops.
(Total 10 min)
Another 5 minutes to sealing those 50 envelops. 
(Total 15 min).
Another 1 minutes to stamp a one envelop out of those 50. 
(Total 16 min)

*So it take 16 minutes to get the first finish product.*
If there's a problem with the finish product, it take 11 mins to figure that out. 

This is the issue of working large batches. 

Since each step takes about 6 seconds, If I takes a single piece flow, it will only take 24(6X4) seconds to get the first finished product.

So, it's important to not to work in larger batches so that we can get fast feedback.

### 2. Minimal Viable Product(MVP)
- MVP is the minimal/cheapest/easiest thing you can build to start testing your hypothesis and gain learning.
	It shouldn't has to be the result of 'phase 1' or beta version of a project.
- At the end of each MVP, you decide whether to pivot or persevere. Focus on what you can learn from each MVP.

### 3. Behavior Driven Development(BDD)
- Behavior Driven Development(BDD) is when we describe the system from the outside in. This is done at integration testing level.
- This is where we are taking the customer's view of the system. 
- BDD testing is usually doing against the user interface to see if the system behave the way it's suppose to. 
	not too concerned with the things going on underneath the hood.

BDD testing uses a single syntax that both the developers and the stakeholders can use to describe and agree on the behavior of the system, on what the system does. 
 
**BDD feature scenarios,**

Now we know who is gonna need the feature, what is they need and why they need it. 
This is the beginning of a 'feature file'.
Then you running through scenarios and here is where we use the common syntax.(Gherkin Syntax)
**Scenario,**
	Given a set of preconditions,
	When an event occurs
	Then some outcome is observed

### 4. Test Driven Development(TDD)
- Test the functions of the system from the inside out. Unlike BDD, it is concerned with the internals of the system.
- Also known as 'unit testing'.
	we want to make sure that given those inputs, i get these outputs at a small module level.
	We don't know if when we put all modules together I'm going to get the behavior I want. That's a part of BDD.
	For TDD,  we are just testing the system way down at the unit/module level.

**TDD Workflow,**
1. Write a test case and watch it fails.
2. Write just enough code to make it pass.
3. Refactor the code to make it better and repeat.

### 5. Pair Programming
- Pair programming is two programmers work together at one workstation. 
	one writes the code.
	other reviews each line of coding as it is typed in.
	The two programmers switches the role frequently.(Ex: 20 min)
- This makes code quality higher and discover defects earlier.
