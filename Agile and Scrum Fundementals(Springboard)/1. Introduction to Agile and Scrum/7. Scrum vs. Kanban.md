In Scrum, we are using 'Kanban boards', but we don't follow the whole Kanban process.

|      |Scrum| Kanban|
|------|-------|--------|
|Cadence| Fixed length sprints| Continuous flow|
|Release Methodology| End of each sprint| Continuous delivery|
|Roles| Product owner, Scrum master, Scrum team| No existing role(optional agile coach)|
|Key metrics| Velocity| Cycle time|
|Change philosophy| Team should strive to not to make changes to the sprint forecast during the sprint| change can happen at any time|

Velocity: velocity is how much work a team can get done in two weeks.
Cycle time: how long does it take to getting something off the assembly line.(produce a complete product)
