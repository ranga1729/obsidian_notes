Proper organization is critical to success. Existing teams may need to be organized before implementing agile in order to take the full advantage of becoming agile. 

### Conway's Law
"Any organization that designs a system(defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure." -Melvin Conway, 1968

what this means is,
Ex:
1. If you as an organization with 4 teams to build a compiler, you will get a 4-pass compiler.
	because you asked 4 teams to create a compiler
2. If you have an UI team, app team and a database team...they will build a 3-tier architecture.
	because you asked 3 teams to create it

### How teams should be aligned
- Teams should be loosely coupled and tightly aligned.
	teams should be loosely coupled because having lot of dependencies is not good.
	teams should be tightly aligned because they are building a single application.
- Each team has it's own mission aligned with the business.
	Ex:
		If we have 50 developers working on a e-commerce product, it's better to break them up into smaller teams like accounts team, shop cart team, recommendation team. 
		They should have the ownership of that business area,
		But they all aligned with the business.
- Teams have end-to-end responsibility for what they build.
- Teams need to have a long-term mission.
	It's not good when you are pulling people on and off projects.

### Autonomy
Team autonomy is the ability to self-organize, make decisions and deliver value without constant supervision or micromanagement. 

**Benefits of having autonomy,**
- It's motivating people to build better things.
- It's fast when decision happen locally in the team level.
- It minimizes hands offs and waiting, so team can get to run at their own speed.

### The Agile dilemma
![[Pasted image 20231202235036.png]]
This image is all about the diametrically opposed metrics that we use with developments and operations.
Development: want new changes out in production.
Operations: wants stability, so they refuse to have changes.
These are diametrically opposed views.

This is why the entire organization need to be Agile.
If the entire organization isn't Agile, it doesn't matter you have a team of Agile. You are not gonna get the benefits. 
### The entire organization must be Agile
This is what looks like when the entire organization isn't adopt to be Agile. 
The Scrum team will complete sprints, build increments every two weeks, but nothing will be deployed because operation teams isn't agile and they are not deploying the changes. 
So the first deployment will be happen after 3 months.

This is what ==**DevOps**== is all about. 
The organization should adopt DevOps, if it want to take the full advantage of becoming Agile. Otherwise they are just going to wait for the Operations team to catch up to the Agile development team. 

### Alignment of Agile and DevOps
|*The goal of Agile*| *The goal of DevOps*|
|-------------------|-----------------|
|Develop software faster| Accelerate time to market|
|Be responsive to change| Improve IT value by more closely aligning development, IT operations and the business|
|Obtain higher quality| Increase IT productivity|
Ops team need to be Agile as the Development team.
