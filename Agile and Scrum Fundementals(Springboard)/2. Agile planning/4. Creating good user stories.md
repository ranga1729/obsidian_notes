### What is a user story ?
- A user story is a small piece of business value that a team can deliver within a done increment/iteration.
- 'User stories' are similar to 'user requirements' but little bit different. 
	Requirements directly saying what the customer needs.
	But User stories includes 'Who is it for? What do they need? and Why do they need?/what is the business value they get out if this feature.'
- Stories should contain,
	1. A brief description of the need and business values.
		What it is ?
		Who needs it ?
		What is the business value we get out of it ?
	2. Any assumptions or any details
		Ex: When the customer needs to implement a database in their product then they will say that they need an relational database. Put that in the user story to give the developer a hint not to look for NOSQL databases.
		This will be helpful to the developer to know what your intentions are. 
	3. Definition of "Done"(An acceptance criteria)
		This is helpful to get to know when the story is completed.

#### 1. Story Description
- User stories document a persona requesting a function to achieve a goal.
- We use a syntax for this,

- When we refine the product backlog, we are going to prioritize the stories based on the business values we expect from those stories/features/requirements.

#### 2. Assumptions and details
List any assumptions and document any details that may help the developers to understand what needs to be done. 

#### 3. Acceptance criteria
- It is critical to document the definition of done. 
- We use "Gherkin Syntax" to document the acceptance criteria.

	Ex: 
		Given I have 5 items in my shopping cart.
		When I add another item to my cart.
		Then I should see 6 items in my cart.

**Sample Story,**
*User story:*
	As a Marketing Manager
	I need a list of customer names and emails
	So that I can notify them of marketing promotions.

*Assumptions and details:*
	We maintain customer emails.(this may be come from another story.)
	Customers have opted-in to promotions

*Acceptance criteria:*
	Given there are 100 customers in the database and 90 have opted into email promotions.
	When I request the customer email list,
	Then I should see a list of 90 customer emails which were opted in to email promotions.

Bill Wake invented the "INVEST" acronym to help us remember guidelines for writing an effective user story.

### Bill Wake's INVEST acronym of guideline for effective user stories
- **I**ndependent
	Stories need to be independent so they can be moved and prioritized over others. If they depend on other stories it's hard to do so. (practically all of them will not independent.)
- **N**egotiable
	They should be negotiable so people can move them/prioritize them and change them in order to value more functionality or less functionality. 
- **Valuable**
	There should be a value to every story that can be benefit to the customer. 
- **E**stimable
	It should be estimable to see how big is it or how small is it. 
- **S**mall
	It should be something that someone can work on it a sprint.
	So it need to smaller than a sprint.
- **T**estable
	Developers should be able to test whether it is done for that story. 

### Epic
- Really big ideas are called "Epics".
- Anytime we have a story that is bigger than a single sprint, we use the term "Epic".
- Since we can't get done an story in a sprint, We make that story an Epic and we add smaller stories that make up the Epic.
- An Epic in a hierarchy is higher than a story. Stories are consumed by Epics.
- If we can't estimate it on its own, then we break it down into smaller things that we can estimate.

#### When to use an Epic
- When a story is too large in scope it is considered an epic.
- Backlog items tend to start as epic when they are lower priority and less defined. 
- For Sprint planning, Epics should be broken into smaller stories that we can put in a sprint.
