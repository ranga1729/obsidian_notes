After backlog refinement, we have to do the sprint planning meeting which will hopefully produce a sprint backlog.

### Sprint Planning
**Purpose:** determine what stories are going to be in the next sprint and how can we accomplish them in the next two weeks by producing the "Sprint backlog".

### Sprint Planning meeting
**Attendees:** 
	Product Owner
	Scrum Master
	Developer team(Cross-functional team)

**Goals:**
	1. Each sprint should have a clearly defined business goals.
	2. And it's important that product owner articulate the goal and  product backlog items support it. So everybody knows why we are doing this and how these stories going to help us achieve whatever goal it is.
	3. It's important for the whole team to understand why they are building the increment. (So over-coding/ over-engineering won't happen and will be delivered exactly what suppose to be done.)

### Mechanics of Sprint Planning
**The development team:**
	1. Takes stories from the top of the product backlog and assign them to the sprint backlog.
	2. Assign story points and labels.
	3. Ensure each story contains enough information for a developer to start working on it.  
	4. Stop adding stories when the team's velocity is reached.

#### Team Velocity
- The number of story points a team can complete in  single sprint. 
- This will change over time as the team gets better at estimating and better at executing.
- The velocity is unique to the team because the story point assignment is unique to the team. So we can't compare the velocity of two teams.

### Create a sprint milestones
- One of the first things you have to do to start the sprint is creating a sprint milestone. 
- The milestone title should be short.
- The description should document the milestone goal.
- Duration should be 2 weeks.

### Build the sprint backlog from the product backlog
**Beginning:**
![[Pasted image 20240103140645.png]]
Last time we assigned labels to each story. Now we have to assign 'Estimate' (story points) to each story and we need to assign a milestone to each story.
Development team decide the milestone and story points.

Then we can move that story into the Sprint backlog from the product backlog.

Now the sprint backlog show we have 8 story points to deal with. repeat this process until we reach the team velocity. 

As an example, let's say the team velocity is 18 story points.
