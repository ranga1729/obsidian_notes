### Labels
Labels helps us to visualize the work.

Labels in GitHub have standards.

when you look at the story and think that it's an enhancement, we can assign the label of enhancement to this story. 

### Technical Debt
Technical debt is anything you need to do that doesn't involve creating a new feature.
	It's not really adding a feature to the product, but it's something you have to do. 
Ex: 
	Vulnerabilities in the code that are external libraries that have to be patched. 
	Code refactoring.
	Setup and maintenance of environments. 
	Changing technology like databases.

Ex:

Now the backlog looks like this,

Now we got our product backlog all refined and we got labels. 
It's a nice visual indicator.

### Backlog Refinement tips
- Backlog should be refined every sprint to to ensure the priorities are correct.
- Have at least two sprints worth of stories groomed. 
- The more time you spend refining the backlog, the easier sprint planning will be.
