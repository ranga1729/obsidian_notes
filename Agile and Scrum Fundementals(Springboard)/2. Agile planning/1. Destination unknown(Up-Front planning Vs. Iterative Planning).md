- Don't decide everything at the point when you know the least.
	At the beginning of the project, we know practically nothing/ very little about the project. 
	And we can't sure about what's going to happen at the end.
	So what's the point of planning everything at the beginning ?
- Plan for what you know.
- Adjust as you know more.
	Because, as you move along, you are getting a clear image about the project. 
- Your estimates will be more accurate in this way.

Summary,
	1. Planning everything at the beginning of a project can lead to missed deadlines.
	2. Iterative planning allows for course corrections and mor accurate estimates.
