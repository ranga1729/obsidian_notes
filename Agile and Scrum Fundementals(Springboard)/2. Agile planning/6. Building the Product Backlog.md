### What is a product backlog ?
Product backlog contains all the unimplemented stories that are not yet in a sprint.
- Stories are ranked in order of importance and business value.
- Top stories should have more details than the stories in the bottom of the backlog because top stories should be sprint ready. With the time and work goes on we will be able to add more details to the bottom stories. 

### EXAMPLE
**Taking requirement from the customer,**
- What: A service for counting things.
- Must allow multiple counters.
- Counters must persist across restarts of services.
- Counters can be reset.

##### Now we need to add those requirements/issues into the Kanban board.

First we have to add them to the "New Issues" bar. 
We need to convert those requirements into 'User stories' using the template.

Ex: 
 1. **As a** User
	**I need** a service that has a counter
	**So that I** can keep track of how many times something was done.
2. **As a** User
	**I need** to have multiple counters
	**So that I** can keep track of several counts at once.
3. **As a** Service provider
	**I need** the service to persist the last known count
	**So that users** don't loose track of their counters.
4. **As a** System Administrator
	**I need** the ability to reset the counter
	**So that I** can redo counting from the start.

##### Now we need to prioritize the backlog. 
![[Pasted image 20231217192717.png]]
we go all new User stories in the 'New Issues' bar. 
We need to divide them into Icebox and Product backlog and then sort them out based on the importance.
Stories we can work on later should go to the Icebox.
Stories we need to work on soon should go the product backlog.

In order to persist the data, we might need to implement a database for this service as it's mentioned in the 2nd story in the product backlog. 
But implementing the initial counter should be done before all of that. So that story become the top of the product backlog. It might be the MVP(Minimal Viable Product.) So my MVP might not come with a database.
