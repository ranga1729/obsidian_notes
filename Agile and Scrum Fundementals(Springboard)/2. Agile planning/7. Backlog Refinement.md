### What is backlog refinement ?
- It's the process of keeping the product backlog ranked by priority so that the important stories are always on top. 
- Then we break larger stories into smaller ones to make sure that all the stories that are near the top are small enough to fit in a sprint.
- Finally we make sure the stories near the top have enough details that a developer can just take them and start working on them once we put them in a sprint plan.

### Backlog Refinement meeting
##### Who should attend ?
- Product owner
	The key person of the meeting. This is the one who should write the stories and he has the vision about the product. 
- Scrum master
	This is the one who going to assist the product owner in refinement process.
- Developer team(Optional)
	- Led developer/ architect
	To get the technical knowledge.

### Goal of Backlog Refinement meeting
- Groom the backlog by ranking the stories in order of importance.
- Make sure the story contains enough information for a developer to start working on it.

Now are at this status. 
For now we only have to focus on first 3 columns. 

With the time goes on, customer needs new requirements and new stories come the 'new issues' columns.

The first thing in the backlog refinement meeting should be address those 'New Issues'. 

### New Issue Triage
Backlog refinement should be start with the 'New Issue' addressing.
Goal: At the end of the backlog refinement meeting, the New Issues column should be empty. 
Because there may be new issues should be on the top of the backlog. 
- Move them into the product backlog if they will be worked on soon. 
- Move them into the icebox if they are a good idea but not for now. 
- Reject them if they are not where you want to go.

### Backlog Refinement Workflow
1. Product owner sorts the product backlog in order of importance.
2. The team may provide estimates and other technical information.
3. Large vague items are split and clarified 
Goal: To make the stories sprint ready.

### Complete the story template
![[Pasted image 20231218000042.png]]
We have created new issues with the beginning of the story template. 
Now we need to add assumptions and details to the template and then add the acceptance criteria using Gherkin syntax.

Ex: 1st story of the backlog can be complete like this.
Story:
	**As a** User
	**I need** a service that has a counter
	**So that I** can keep track of how many times something was done.
