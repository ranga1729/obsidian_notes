### Agile planning tools
- Tools won't make you Agile, tools can only support your Agile process.

#### ZenHub
- ZenHub is a plug-in to GitHub.
- It allows you to add project management tools like a Kanban board, and some reporting tools while you remain in GitHub.
- ZenHub is customizable and integrated with GitHub. 

**Why ZenHub ?**
- Since it's integrated with GitHub, ZenHub uses GitHub issues/data.
	You don't have to go off and edit like you are using a separate software. 
- It provides an easy way to understand what is going on.
	Provides an easy way to let management know all the issues that are still in sprint, haven't been worked on, all the issues that are currently being worked on and who's working on them and all of the issues we already have done.
- It maintains up-to-date status dues to integration with GitHub.
- It allows developers use only one tools - GitHub.

### What is a Kanban board ?
![[Pasted image 20231210122028.png]]
- It consist of thing you need to do, things that you are doing and things that you already have done. And you move things/cards across the Kanban board, in order to show the progress.

This is a real Kanban board and it just a whiteboard with some sticky notes sticked on to it.
4 columns in there. 
	The Product back log, 
	on deck(things need to be done), 
	doing(thing going on right now), 
	done(things that already have done).
You take a sticky note, write a story on it and move it across the columns. 

#### ZenHub Pipelines

- New Issues: like an message inbox. When anybody opens up an issue, it defaults to going into the issues columns.
- Icebox: it is where you put things that are going to be long term.
- Product Backlog: everything you ever want to do forever in your product that you haven't done yet. It doesn't contain things that your are doing. It contain all the things you haven't put in a sprint that you want to work out at some time in the future.
- Sprint backlog: contains things that we are going to do in the next two weeks. Take things from the product backlog and and move them to the sprint backlog to make a sprint plan. Now developers don't have to focused on other things other than the sprint backlog.
- In progress: Developers assign work to themselves from the sprint backlog. When a developer assign a work in the sprint backlog to himself, his avatar will show up on that card. So the product owner can see exactly who is working on what and what is being worked on. Once the work is complete, developers usually create a pull request to pull their work back into the base branch. Those request will show up in Review/QA pipeline.
- Review/QA: You can configure GitHub and ZenHub so that is automatically create pull requests in that review QA column. 
- Done: After reviewing is done, we merge our code and then move the story to the done column. Done means the developer is done, it doesn't means that it's been accepted by the product owner. That is something happen during the sprint review. When the developer is done with that story, they can go back to the sprint backlog, pull another story in to in-progress pipeline, assign it to themselves and keep working. 

The flow is going from left to right.
New stories come in on the left side, and a done increment winds up going out on the right.
