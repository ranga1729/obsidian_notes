### Formula for failure
- Placing people in a new role without giving them training.
	Ex:
	1. Product manager becomes product owner.
		Product manager is a job title and a product owner is a scrum role.
	2. Project manager becoming the Scrum master with no training on how to be a scrum master.
	3. Developers becomes scrum team.
		But they are just software engineers. There's no Ops people or business analysts.

### Product manager Vs. Product owner
|Product Manager| Product Owner|
|------------|------------|
|A business person who manages the budget| Visionary who leads the team in a series of experiments designed to achieve the sprint goals|
|Mostly focused on operational aspects of the business| Conduit between the stakeholders and the team, translating between business and technical goals|

### Project manager Vs. Scrum master
|Project Manager| Scrum Master|
|------------------|----------|
|A task master who keeps everyone marching to a fixed plan| Coach that keeps the team focused on the current sprint|
|Document impediments as a project risks| Eliminates impediments while buffering team from interruptions|

### Development team Vs. Scrum team
|Development Team| Scrum Team|
|---------------------|------|
|Consist only of developers| Cross-functional team that includes developers, testers, security, business analysts, operations and more|

- You can't put put people in new roles without the proper training and mindset. 
	Otherwise a project manager who became a product owner without proper training and a mindset will as hard as they might turn a Kanban board into a Gantt chart. 
- This mindset must come down from upper management.
