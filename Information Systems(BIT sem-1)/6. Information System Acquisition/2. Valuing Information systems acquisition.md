Information systems can be used in three ways to add value to an organization, 
1. Automating
	Doing things faster, cheaper & more accurately with more consistency
2. Informating
	Doing things better, learn & improve processes, support organizational learning
3. Strategizing
	Gain or sustain a competitive advantage over rivals
	Turning benefits of automating & informating into strategic advantage

Five types of organizational strategies,
1. Overall Low Cost Leadership Strategy.
	company aims to become the most cost-efficient player in its industry.
	producing goods or providing services at a lower cost than competitors by achieving economies of scale, optimizing operations, and minimizing waste. 
	The ultimate goal is to **increase market share** or **achieve higher profitability** by offering the most attractive price point to customers.
2. Focused Low-Cost Strategy.
	company targets a specific niche market and aims to become the most cost-efficient player within that niche.
3. Broad Differentiation Strategy
	Offer better products/services than competitors.
	Company aims to stand out from competitors across a wide market segment, offering unique features, superior quality, or other differentiating values that appeal to a large and diverse group of customers.
4. Focused Differentiation Strategy
	Offer better products/services than competitors to a niche market.
	Company targets a specific narrow market segment and aims to stand out from competitors by offering unique features, superior quality, or other differentiating values that cater to the specific needs and preferences of that segment.
5. Best Cost Provider Strategy
	Provide products of reasonably good quality at competitive price. 

Things to consider when making a business case for Information system,
1. Identify organizational strategy
2. Identify IS benefits.
3. Identify the cost.
4. Identify productivity gains. 
### Productivity Paradox of Information Systems
The **productivity paradox of information systems** refers to the seemingly contradictory phenomenon where, despite significant investments in information technology (IT), there has not been a corresponding increase in productivity growth.

Reasons,
1. Difficulty to measure and quantify
	- It can be challenging to accurately measure both productivity and the impact of IT. Traditional methods of measuring productivity may not capture the full value if IT investments such as improvements in customer service, quality or flexibility.
	- May measure wrong things
	- Effectiveness vs. Efficiency
2. Time lags
	- Benefits don't always occur at the same time as implementation.
	- Some IT implementations require people to gain experience.
	- System must be integrated with existing systems.
3. Mismanagements
	- Bad business model not overcome by good IS.
	- Creation of unanticipated bottlenecks.
4. Redistributions
	- Increase in market share may come as the expense of the competitors market share.

### Investment Evaluation(Multi-criteria Analysis & Cost-benefit Analysis)
Investment Analysis/Evaluation is the process of evaluating an investment in each attribute of investments. It involves evaluating it's attributes in order to evaluate the investment. 

Two methods,
1. Cost-Benefit Analysis
2. Multi-criteria Analysis

### 1. Cost-Benefit Analysis(CBA)
Cost-Benefit analysis is a systematic approach to quantify the cost & benefits of a decision or a project. 
(calculate the cost of manufacturing the product/service and then compare it with the benefits to be obtained.)
It's essentially a way to weigh the pros and cons to determine whether a particular option is worthwhile.

Calculation of Cost-Benefit analysis,
1. Cost to be spent to build up the alternative.
2. Profit to be gained from the alternative
3. Time value of cost, incomes and profits

continue from IS 6th module, page 13

**Steps of performing a cost benefit analysis,**
Step 1 : Brainstorm costs and benefits.
Step 2 : Assign a monetary value to the costs.
Step 3 : Assign a monetary value to the benefit. 
Step 4 : compare costs and benefits.

Cost Benefit analysis(CMB) provides valuable insight when,
1. Developing benchmark for comparing projects
2. Deciding whether to pursue a proposed projects. 
3. Evaluating new hires.
4. Weighing investment opportunities.
5. Measuring social benefits. 
6. Appraising the desirability of suggested policies.
7. Assessing change initiative.
8. Quantifying effects on stakeholders and participants.

### Multi-Criteria Analysis
A two stage decision procedure. 

**Stage** 1 : Identifies a set of goals or objectives and then seeks to identify the trade-offs between those objectives for different policies or for different ways of achieving a given policy. 
**Stage 2** : Seeks to identify the 'best' policy by attaching weights(scores) to the various objectives.

## Identifying and Implementing Innovations
Reasons why successful innovation is difficult,
1. Innovation is often fleeting.(Advantages gained or short lived.)
2. Innovation is often risky. (Superior products may not win the race)
3. Innovation choices are often difficult. (Cannot foresee the future.)

**The innovators dilemma,**
The "Inventor's dilemma" is not actually about inventors themselves, but a challenge faced by established companies, balancing current success with future threats. 
- Companies listen to their main customers, making great products that sell well. 
- New, simpler technologies emerge for smaller markets. They are not flashy, but they improve steadily. 
- Established companies hesitate to adopt these "disruptive" technologies. They seem inferior and risky.
- Over time, the simpler tech gets better, attracting more customers, even threatening the established giants. 

Solution,
- Understand different customer needs.
- Experiment with new ideas.
- Start early, adapt early. 
- Educate the organization.
- Build a team of expert innovators. 
- Execute leadership. 

Organizational requirements for innovations,
- Process requirements
	The organization has to do whatever it takes to implement the change.
- Resource requirements
- The need to have the human capital necessary for deployment of the system.
- the organizational members must have appropriate tolerance of risk and uncertainty.

#### e-business innovation cycle,
![[Pasted image 20240204222515.png]]
- Choosing enabling/emerging technologies.
- Matching technologies to opportunities. (Most promising new technologies matches with the current economic opportunities.)
- Executing business innovations for growth.
- Assessing value.(asses value created for customers and internal operations.)
