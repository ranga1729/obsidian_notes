**System Acquisition**: The process used to obtain the information systems resources needed to provide the services necessary to meet a specific set of needs. 

**System Development:** The process of defining, designing, testing and implementing a software application or program in building and information system to meet end-users needs. 

**Buys off-the-shelf software:** Buying existing software developed by a software manufacturer  enables an organization to test drive and evaluate it before making a major commitment to purchase it and install it. 

### Systems Development Process
#### 1. Waterfall system development process
![[Pasted image 20240205025822.png]]
A sequential, multistage systems development process in which work on the next stage cannot begin until the result of the current stage is reviewed and approved or modified as necessary. 

Major issue with the waterfall approach is that users do not interact with the solution until the integration and testing phase. This can lead to a mismatch between system capabilities, user expectations and organizational needs. 
##### Investigation
Gain a clear understanding of the specifics of the problem.
##### System Analysis
Gathering data on the existing system, determining the requirements, considering alternatives with identified constraints, investigating the feasibility of alternative solution.
##### Design
Design and creates a complete set of technical specifications that can be used to construct the information system.
The result should be a technical design that includes outputs, inputs, user interfaces, hardware, software, database, telecommunication, personnel and procedure and shows how the components are interrelated.

##### Development
Converts the system design into a operational system by 
	coding and testing software programs, 
	creating and loading data into the database, 
	performing initial program testing(unit testing). 

##### Integration and Testing
Several tests must be conducted before a system put into production. 
Ex:
	integration testing
	System testing
	Volume testing
	User acceptance testing

Types of tests...

| Type of test | what is tested | Purpose of the test | Who does it |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Unit | Individual units of the system | Check each unit performs as designed. | Software developers. |
| Integration | Test individual units all together. | Uncover defects between individual components. | Software developers/individual testers (using blac-kbox method) |
| System | Test the complete system with software, hardware, database, people and procedures. | Validate the systems meets all requirements. | Independent tester.(without developers) |
| Volume | Evaluate the systems performance under realistic and varying work load and different conditions.  | Identify any issues that prevent the system from performing at the required service level. | System development teams and member of the organization. |
| User acceptance | Test the complete system with users. | Verify the system can perform in a real world environment. | Trained users of the systems. |

##### Implementation
Steps,
- User preparation: Readying the users to accepts the new system.
- Site preparation: Readying the location of the new system.
- Installation: Physically placing the computer equipment on the site and making it operational.
- Cutover: Process of switching from the old system to the new system.

##### System operation and Maintenance
Steps,
- System operation: Use the new system under all kinds of operating conditions. 
- System maintenance: changing and enhancing the system
- System disposal: Disposing of all equipment in an environmentally friendly way, closing out contracts, Safely migrating data to another system or archive it.

**Advantages and disadvantages of Waterfall system development process,**

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---- | ---- |
| Formal review at the end of each phase allows maximum management control. | System is developed in a way that developers understood the user requirements. |
| Requires considerable system documentations to trace every business needs.  | Often user go unstated or miscommunicated or misunderstood. |
| Produces many intermediate components that can be reviewed to measure progress towards developing the system. | Users can't easily review intermediate components. |

#### 2. Agile Development
![[Pasted image 20240205115551.png]]
An iterative system development process that develops the system in "sprint" increments lasting from two weeks to two months. 
- Scrum: An agile development framework that emphasizes a team based approach in order to keep the development effort focused and moving quickly. 
- Scrum master: The person who coordinates all the scrum activities of a team. 
- EXteme Programming(XP): A form of agile development that promotes incremental development of a system using short development cycles to improve productivity and to accommodate new customer requirements.  

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---- | ---- |
| Puts an application into production sooner than any other approach. | Intense process that can burn out developers and other project participants. |
| Documentation is produced as a by-product of completing tasks. | requires system analysts and users to be skilled on using agile tools and techniques. |
| Lots of interactions between users and stakeholders. | Requires a larger percentage of stakeholders' and users' time than other approaches. |

#### Waterfall Vs Agile
| Characteristics | Agile | Waterfall |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Description | Iterative process that develops the system in print increments lasting 2-8 weeks. Each increments focuses on implementing the highest priority requirements that can be completed in the sprint.  | A sequential multistage process where the next stage can not begin until the results of the previous stage are reviewed and approved.  |
| Basic assumptions | System requirements cannot be fully defined at start of the project.  | all critical system requirements must be fully defined before any coding begins.  |
| How requirements and design are defined | Users interacting with system analysts and working software.  | Users interacting with system analysts and system documentation and/or models. |
| Associated processes | Scrum | Structured system analysts and design. |

### Buying off-the-shelf software
- Software manufacturers enables organizations to test drive and evaluate their products before making a major commitment to purchase and install them. 
- The effort requires to modify the software packages must taken into account as a major factor in selecting the final vendor and software. 
- Once purchased, the existing software can be installed with minimal disruptions and user requirements can be quickly met & the organization can obtain the benefits from the systems. 

![[Pasted image 20240205124542.png]]
##### Investigation & System analysis
Decide which option is best between buying off-the-shelf software or build a custom application, by the end of the system analysis phase. (make-or-buy decision)
##### Package Evaluation Phase
When purchasing an off-the-shelf software, an organization should ensure to purchase the best products that meets with their needs. 
Steps,
1. Identify potential solutions.
2. Research and select top vendors.
3. Perform final evaluation of leading solutions.
4. finalize the selection and finalize the contract.
##### Integration and Testing
If the software package has been modified to meet the organizational needs, it must be tested before put into the workspace.
Type of tests,
1. Integration testing
2. system testing
3. Volume testing
4. User acceptance testing
##### Implementation
Key implementation tasks,
1. Use data flow diagrams to map current business process and requirements to the software and identify any gaps that must be filled by changing current processes or by modifying the software.
2. Install the software and configure all of its capabilities and options to meet the project requirements. 
3. Integrate existing software with the new software. 
4. Train end users.
5. Test the software to ensure that it meets all processes and requirements.
6. Convert historical data from the old software so that it can be used by the new software.
7. Roll out the new software to users in work environment.
8. Provide ongoing end-user support and training.

### Sourcing Methods
1. In-sourcing
2. Outsourcing and Offshoring
3. Co-Sourcing
##### In-sourcing
Organization performs activities internally using internal resources and governance. 

##### Outsourcing
A long-term business arrangement in which a company contracts for service with an outside organization that has expertise.

| Degree of integration | External resources |
| ---- | ---- |
| Durtion | Long-term |
| Allocation of control | Fully governance by the supplier, residual rights are owned by the supplier during the delivery process. |

Reasons to go with outsourcing,
- Achieve greater ROI.
- Focus on core competencies.
- Achieve flexible staffing levels.
- Gain access to global resources.
- Decrease time-to-market.

##### Offshoring
An outsourcing arrangement with an abroad company.
Offshoring can be defined as a reallocation of an organization's business process to a lower-cost location, usually overseas.
##### Co-Sourcing
Co-sourcing combines the advantages of outsourcing and insourcing as it provides access to external expertise without having to completely give up internal control over processes.
