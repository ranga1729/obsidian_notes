### Characteristics of Quality Information
| Characteristic | Definition |
| ---- | ---- |
| Accessible | Information should be easily accessible by authorized users. |
| Accurate | Accurate information is error free. (In some cases inaccurate information is generated and fed into the transformation process. It's called 'garbage in, garbage out') |
| Complete | Complete information contains all the important facts. |
| Economical | Information should be relatively economical to produce. Decision makers must always balance the value of information with the cost of producing it. |
| Flexible |  |
| Relevant |  |
| Reliable | Reliable information can be trusted by users. In many cases, the reliability of the information depends on the data-collection method, source of the information. |
| Secure |  |
| Simple | Information should be simple, not complex. Sophisticated and detailed information might not be needed. In fact, too much information can cause information overload and decision makers would be exhausted by the amount of information. |
| Timely | Information value is relevant to the time. |
| Verifiable | Information should be verifiable by several sources. |

### What is a system ?
A system is a interrelated components, with a clearly defined boundary, working together to achieve a common set of objectives. 

**Subsystem**: a system within a system. A system make up of subsystems.
**sub-subsystems**: a system within a sub system.

#### Issues related to Information Systems
- **Fluctuating computing needs** : on-demand computing
- **Large scale problems** : Grid computing
- **Cost issues related to bandwidth and processing speed** : Edge computing
- **Low reliability and high maintenance cost** : Autonomic computing
- **Cost, access, software selections and update issues** : Cloud computing

### On-demand Computing
On-demand computing means allocate available resources based on user's needs. (pay-as-you-go/ pay-per-use basis)
Rent resources from an external provider(utility computing)
	Rent resources for processing, data storage or networking on 'as-needed' basis. Tenant receives monthly bill for the services used. Service provider should do the tasks such as managing, maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure. All charges are added to the utility bill. 

### Grid Computing
Grid computing is a distributed processing system that harnesses the combined power of multiple computers from different locations to solve complex problems or large-scale tasks. 
By working together seamlessly, the grid effectively acts as a single, powerful virtual supercomputer, capable of tackling massive computational challenges.

Benefits of Grid computing,
- Increased processing power
- Enhanced efficiency 
- Cost-effectiveness
	cheaper than maintaining a supercomputer with equivalent power.
- Flexibility and scalability
	Grids can be easily scaled up or down by adding or removing computers needed. 

### Edge Computing
![[Pasted image 20240116214431.png]]
Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the source of data. 

Cloud computing is like having all your files and applications stored in a big library far away. When you need something you have to send a request to the library, wait for it to be retrieved. 

Edge computing is like having a smaller library right in your own home. You can access files and applications as you want.

### Autonomic computing 
autonomic computing refers to a vision of highly automated distributed computing systems that can manage themselves with minimal human intervention. 
Ex: self driving cars 

Characteristics, 
- Self-configuration
	automatically configure themselves for optimal performance based on their environment and user needs.
