### What is IT Security ?
![[Pasted image 20240205210413.png]]
**Confidentiality** : Assurance that information is  accessible only to those authorized to have access. Confidentiality breaches may occur due to improver data handling or a hacking attempt. 
**Integrity** : The trustworthiness of data or resources in terms of preventing improper and unauthorized changes. Assurance that information can be relied upon to be sufficiently accurate for its purpose. 
**Availability** : Assurance that the systems responsible for delivering, storing and processing information are accessible when required by the authorized users.

### Security Threats and Attacks
**Why Computer Incidents are so prevalent,**
- Increasing complexity increases vulnerability.
- Higher computer user expectations.
- Expanding and changing systems introduce new risks. 
- Increased prevalence of bring your own device(BYOD) policies
- Growing reliance on commercial software with known vulnerabilities.
- Increasing sophistication of those who would do harm.

### Computer Crime
Computer crime is defined by the **Association of Information Technology Professionals(AITP)** as including,
1. The unauthorized use, access, modification and destruction of hardware, software, data or network resources.
2. Unauthorized release of information.
3. Unauthorized copying of software.
4. Denying an end user access to his or her own hardware, software, data or network resources.
5. Using or conspiring to use computer or network resources to obtain information or tangible property illegally.

### Perpetrator of Computer Crime
| Type of Perpetrator | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| Blackhat hacker | Violates computer or Internet security maliciously or illegal personal gain. |
| Cracker | An individual who causes problem, steal data and corrupts systems.  |
| Malicious insider | An employee or contractor who attempt to gain financially and/or disrupt a company's information systems and business operations. |
| Industrial Spy | An individual who captures trade secrets and attempt to gain an unfair competitive advantage. |
| Cybercriminla | Someone who attacks a computer or network for financial gain. |
| Hacktivist | An individual who hacks computer or web sites in an attempt to promote a political ideology. |
| Cyberterrorist | Someone who attempts to destroy the infrastructure components of governments, financial institution and other corporations, utilities and emergency response units.  |

### Common Hacking Tactics & Security Exploits
- Denial of Service(DOS)
- Vulnerability Scan
- Packet Sniffer
- Spoofing(Phishing)
- Trojan Horses
- Backdoors
- Malicious applets
- War dialing
- Logic Bombs
- Buffer overflow
- Password crackers
- Social engineering
- Dumpster diving

### Types of Exploits
- Ransomware : Malware that stops you from your computer or accessing your data until you meet certain demands such as paying a ransom or sending photos to the attackers.
- Virus : A pieces of programming code, usually disguised as something else that causes a computer to behave in an unexpected and usually undesirable manner.
- worm : a harmful program that resides in the active memory of the computer and duplicates itself. 
- Trojan Horse : A seemingly harmless program in which malicious code is hidden. 
- Logic Bomb : A form of trojan horse malware that executes when it is triggered by a specific event.
- Blended Treat : A sophisticated threat that combines the features of a virus, worm, Trojan horse and other malicious code into a single payload.
- Spam : The use of email systems to send unsolicited email to large number of people. 
- Distributed Denial of service(DDoS) : an attack in which a malicious hacker takes over computer via the internet and causes them to flood a target site with demands for data and other small tasks. 
- Botnet : a term uses to describe a large group of computers that are controlled from one or more remote locations by hackers without the knowledge or consent of their owners. 
	- Zombie : a computer that has been taken over by a hacker to be used as a part of a botnet.
- Rootkit : a set of programs that enables  its user to gain administrator level access to a computer without the end user's consent or knowledge.
- Advanced Persistent Threat(APT) : A network attack in which an intruder gains access to a network and stays here, undetected with the intention of stealing data over a long period of time. 
- Phishing : The act of fraudulent using email to try to get the recipient to reveal personal data.
- Identity Theft : The theft of personal information, which is then uses without the owner's permission. 
- Data Breach : The unintended release of sensitive data or the access of sensitive data by unauthorized individuals.

### Information System Security Planning and Management
**Goal** : Accuracy, integrity and safety of all information system processes and resources.

Steps of implementing secure & reliable computing,
1. Risk Assessment
2. Detection, Response & Prevention
3. Establish security policy
4. Educating employees and contract workers.
#### 1. Risk Assessment
The process of assessing security-related risk to an organization's computer and networks from both internal and external threats. 

**Step 1 :** Identify the IS assets that are most important to the organization, organization's mission and the business goals.
**Step 2 :** Identify the loss events, risks or threats that could occur.
**Step 3 :** Assess the frequency of events or the possibility of each potential threat.
**Step 4 :** Determine the impact of each treat occurring.(minor threats/major threats)
**Step 5 :** Determine how each threat can be mitigated.
**Step 6 :** Assess the feasibility of implementing the mitigation options. 
**Step 7 :** Perform a Cost-Benefit Analysis(CBA) to ensure that your efforts will be cost effective. 
**Step 8 :** Decide whether or not to implement particular counter measures.

#### 2. Detection
**Intrusion Detect System(IDS) :** Software or hardware that monitors system & activities then notifies network security personnel when it detects network traffic that attempt to circumvent the security measures of a networked computer environment.

### 3. Response
- Incident Notification
- Protection of evidence and activity logs
- Incident containment
- Eradication
- Incident follow-up
### 4. Prevention
- Implementing a corporate firewall
- Utilizing a security dashboard.
- Installing antivirus software on personnel computers.
- Implementing safeguard against attacks by malicious insiders.
- Addressing the most critical internet security threats.
- Conducting periodic IT security audits.
### Establishing a Security Policy
**Security policy :** A statement that defines an organization's security requirements.
Security policies delineates responsibilities and the behavior expected from employees of the organization. 

### Tools of Security Management

##### Inter-network Security Defenses
**Encryption**
	Encryption involves using special mathematical algorithms or keys to transform digital data into an encoding before they are transmitted and then to decode the data when they are received.
	![[Pasted image 20240206000224.png]]
**Firewall**
	A firewall serves as a gatekeeper systems that protects a company's intranets and other computer networks from intrusion by providing a filter and safe transfer point for access to and from the internet and other networks.

**Other Security Measures**
- Anti-virus software
- Security codes
- Backup Files
- Security Monitors
- Biometric Security
- Computer Failure Controls
- Fault-Tolerant Systems
- Disaster Recovery
