BI systems deals with the
	extraction,
	transformation,
	integration,
	visualization,
	analysis,
	interpretation and 
	presentation of data to support improved decision making. 
- In other words, BI systems are more associated with querying, reporting, online analytical processing and 'alerts'.

#### Business Reporting and Analytics
- BI analytics makes much more extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive modeling and fact-based management to drive decision making. 
- Analytics may be used to help human decisions or may drive fully automated decisions. 

#### Business Intelligence Tools/Analytical Techniques
![[Pasted image 20240130192405.png]]
1. Spreadsheets
2. Reporting and Querying tools
3. Data visualization
4. Online analytical processing(OLAP)
5. Drill-down analysis
6. Linear regression
7. Data mining
8. Dashboard

#### Online Analytical Processing(OLAP)
Online analytical processing is the method of analyzing multidimensional data from many different perspectives. 
OLAP involves several basic analytical operations.
	Ex: Consolidation, Drill-down, Slicing and Dicing

#### CRISP-DM Process
![[Pasted image 20240130194213.png]]
CRISP-DM stands for **"Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining"** is a widely used framework for guiding data mining and analytics projects. 
It  provides a structured approach to planning, organizing and implementing these projects, ensuring that all critical aspects are addressed and that you effectively extract insights from your data.

Here is the 6 main phases in the CRISP-DM process,
1. Business Understanding
	- Define the business goal and objectives for the project.
	- Identify key stakeholders and their needs.
	- Asses resources and constraints.
2. Data understanding
	- Explore and familiarize yourself with the available data. 
	- Identify the data quality issues and clean the data.
	- Analyze the data distribution and relationship between variables. 
3. Data preparation
	- Select and pre-process the relevant data features.
	- Transform or impute missing values.
	- Encode categorical variables and derive new features.
4. Modeling
	- Choose and apply appropriate data mining techniques.
	- Build and train different models using the prepared data.
	- Evaluate and compare the performances of different models. 
5. Evaluation
	- Assess the models against the business objectives.
	- Validate the models on unseen data and check for overfitting. 
	- Interpret the result and draw conclusion.
6. Deployment
	- Implement the best model into a production environment.
	- Monitor the model performance and provide feedback.
	- Update and improve the model over time.

Key feature of CRIPS-DM,
1. Flexible and adaptable: Â Can be customized to fit different project types and data sizes.
2. Iterative: Allows revisiting previous phases based on new insights or challenges.
3. Communication-focused: Encourages communication between data scientists and stakeholders.
4. Proven effectiveness: Widely used and recognized by data professionals.

#### Information Visualization
Visualization represent complex data using interactive, three-dimensional, graphical forms. 
Presenting analytical results visually helps users discover patterns, links and anomalies in business data. 
This assists interactive knowledge discovery and decision support process.
