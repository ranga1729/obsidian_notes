## Active Voice
In active voice, the **subject** performs the action stated by the **verb**. 
It follows a clear **Subject + Verb + Observe**
	Ex: The cat chased the rat. 
#### Why should I use active voice ?
- It highlights the logical flow of the action, from the subject(or doer) to the object(or receiver) of the action. 
- It makes your sentences clear and straightforward. 
- Useful in academic writing. 

## Passive Voice
In passive voice, the subject is acted upon by the verb. It makes a less straightforward sentence compared to the active voice.
	Ex: The rat was chased by the cat. 
A passive construction occurs when you make the **object** of an **action** into the **subject** of a sentence. 
#### Why should I use passive voice
- The passive voice is used when when we want to focus attention on the person or thing affected by the action. 

#### How to form a passive voice
1. The object of the active sentence should become the subject of the passive sentence.
2. The finite form of the verb is changed (to be + past participle) the subject of the active sentence should become the object of the passive sentence (or is dropped).
Ex: 
	ACTIVE : The cat chased the rat.
	PASSIVE : The rat was chased by the cat.

#### Use the active voice
In speaking as well as writing, use active voice as much as possible. 
Passive voice sentence often use more words, can be vague and may head towards a tangle of prepositional phrases which leads to confusion. 
However, passive voice is mostly used in academic writing whereas active voice us often used in non-scientific writing. 
Ultimately it is the writer who should take a wise decision as to which voice he/she should stick to.

#### When to use passive voice ?
1. For typical situations. 
	Robots are used for risky actions.
2. To avoid direct responsibility. 
	A mistake was made. 
3. When the author/doer of the action is now known or is irrelevant. 
	The decision was made. 
4. For emphasis.
	The yellow car was destroyed by the bus. (not the blue car)

### Academic Writing
Passive voice is often used in academic writing because we usually do not need to focus on who is doing the action but on the receiver of the action. 
Passive voice allows writers to highlight the most important participant or event within sentences by placing them at the beginning of the sentence. 
Ex:

In academic writing it is often sounds somewhat unprofessional to repeatedly state the subject(doer) of the action. Passive voice is a useful way to avoid this. Use of a passive voice also contribute in avoiding informal personal pronouns. 

Ex: Random interviews were conducted in order to get the views of the foreigners who visit Sigiriya. 
(This doesn't mention about the interviewer. It's obvious that it was the author.)
