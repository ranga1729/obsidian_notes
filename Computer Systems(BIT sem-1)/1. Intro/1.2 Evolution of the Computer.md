#### Abacus(3000BC)
![[Pasted image 20231206124944.png]]
An ancient calculating device. Still being used in China, Russia and far east.

#### Pascaline(1642)
![[Pasted image 20231206125055.png]]
Pascaline is a desktop mechanical adding machine. Developed by "Blaise Pascal."

#### Analytical Engine(1830s)
![[Pasted image 20231206125801.png]]
Invented by "Charles Babbage"(AKA the father of computers).
Designed to store 1000 50-digit numbers for calculations and decisions.
It had a storage capacity of 1000 such numbers. 
It included a conditional function to change the order of instruction execution. 
Used punch cards to program the machine and operated using steam power.
Since it included the units which general purpose computer has today, it considered the real predecessor for general purpose computers used today.
Those units were,
	1. An input device : punch cards provided the inputs
	2. A control unit : used to program the processor
	3. A processor(calculator) : a unit consisted mechanical parts to process data
	4. Storage : hold 1000 50-digit numbers.
	5. An output device : used to print the final result

#### Punched Cards(1800s)
![[Pasted image 20231206130540.png]]
First used by "Joseph Jacquard". A punch card with holes in certain places so that a computer can read data coded from the combination of holes.

#### Tabulating Machine(1890s)
Invented by "Herman Hollerith" to tabulate US Cencus data. Electrical powered and used punch card system.

#### Mark I (1944)
A programmable, general purpose computer.
Invented by "Dr. Howard Aiken".

#### Electronic computers based on digital switching
- The first digital electronic computer was created by John V Atanasoff during 1937-1942. "Atanasoff-Berry Computer"(ABC) was the first to use modern digital switching techniques. Vacuum tubes were used as switches. The concept of using binary arithmetic and logic circuits were introduced to computing world by this ABC.
	![[Pasted image 20231207015953.png]]
- ENIAC(Electrical Numerical Integrator and Calculator) is the first large-scale electronic computer, invented in 1946 by John Presper Ecker and John William Mauchly. This was a valve based computer and now referred to as a first generation computer.
	1000 times faster than previous generation computers.
	Used approximately 18,000 vacuum tubes and occupied 1,800 square feet of floor space and consumed 180,000 watts of electrical power.
	Punch cards were used as input and output.
	ENIAC had to be rewired and switched for each program to be run.
	![[Pasted image 20231207020822.png]]
- John Von Neumann introduced the idea of using the computer as a fixed physical structure and to used programmed control, without the need for any changes in hardware. This concept is known as the "stored-program technique".    This idea became the based for the modern computers. 
	![[Pasted image 20231207021103.png]]
- Around 1947, EDVAC and UNIVAC(Universal Automatic Computer) were introduced using the Von Neumann architecture. 
	These computers used the idea of RAM for the first time. 
	RAM is used to store program data when the computer is functioning. 
	They used machine language to write programs and later high-level languages started. 
	UNIVAC was the first true general purpose computer which was able to manipulate both alphabetic and numerical programs.

### UNIVAC to modern computers
- First electronic computers used Vacuum tubes as switches. They ha lots of issues with vacuum tubes. Early computers used a three pin vacuum tube called "triode". This consumed lot of electrical power and generated a massive amount of heat and in turn lead to frequent tube failures. 
	![[Pasted image 20231207022131.png]]
- The invention of transistors made a revolution of computers. Since the transistors are smaller in size, it made computers much smaller. Transistors are much faster, reliable and efficient than vacuum tubes.
	![[Pasted image 20231207025422.png]]
- The introduction of "Integrated circuits(ICs)" which contains millions of transistors in a small pack, have made computers more and more smaller. 
	![[Pasted image 20231207025654.png]]
	The first IC contained only 6 transistors. 
	In June 2001, Intel researches invented the world's smallest transistor. 
	In 2003 AMD Athlon 64 processor was introduces with 105.9 million transistors and Pentium 4 Extreme edition processor was introduced with more than 178 million transistors.

	1. Supercomputers
	2. Mainframe computers
	3. Minicomputers
	4. Network servers
	5. Personal computers

#### 1. Supercomputers
- The most powerful computer system available. 
- Designed to perform large amounts of workloads and are used by research organizations, universities and organizations which perform tasks which require enormous amount of computing power. 
	Ex: used to run simulations and modeling complex systems like weather, chemical processes, economical predictions, motion of galaxies.
![[Pasted image 20231207105520.png]]
#### 2. Mainframe Computers
- Mainframes are large powerful systems.
- User access the mainframe computer through a terminal. 
- Two types of terminals,
	1. Dumb terminals
		do not do any processing.
		used to connect and get tasks done by using the resources(processor, memory, storage) of the mainframe computer.
	2. Intelligent terminals
			Has a limited processing power. 
			mostly don't have the capability to store data. 
- you can also use a standard personal computer to connect the mainframe and it allow you to perform your tasks in a working environment. 
- A large mainframe can handle even more than 1000 users at a given time.
	Ex: Airline ticket reservations.
- Mostly the mainframe is configured to handle a particular task so that the full utilization of the mainframe computer can be used for processing that task.
	Ex: 
		A bank to handle the banking system, 
		An airline to handle the flight reservation system
