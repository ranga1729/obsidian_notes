- A computer can be classified as a device that takes in raw data as input and process it and provides information as the output. The computer also has the ability to store data.
- The computer system consists of hardware(physical components), software and users that are necessary to make the computer function and to process data in a meaningful way and store data. 
- Categorization of hardware of a computer system, 
	1. Processor, memory and integrating devices
		(Ex: CPU, motherboard, main memory, power supply, VGA card, Sound card, LAN card)
	2. Input devices
		(Ex: Keyboard, pointer devices like mouse, scanner, microphone, webcam)
	3. Output devices
		(Ex: monitor, printer, speaker)
	4. Storage devices
		(Ex: hard drives, DVDs, memory cards and flash drives)

## The Processor
- The processor is capable of receiving information from its input devices and then processing that information and to provide and output. It also has the ability to store this information in a storage device. The processor is responsible for controlling the various devices of a computer.
- But the processor in incapable of learning, it's a device that follow the instruction that have been given to it by the programmer.

### Memory
- Two types,
	1. RAM (Random Access Memory)
	2. ROM (Read Only Memory)

**RAM(Random Access Memory)** 
- Temporarily store data.
- RAM can be read from and written into. 
- Volatile memory.(data get destroyed with the power goes off)
- Faster than a permanent storage device.
Ex: CMOS(Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) chip requires power from a battery to retain the data once the computer is turned off.

**ROM (Read Only Memory)**
- Non-volatile(data doesn't get destroyed with the power goes off)
- Store data permanently. 
- Type of memory which can only be read from.
Ex: BIOS

### Input and Output Devices
Used to interact with the user.

**Input Devices,**
- Any device that can feed data or information into a computer is referred to as a input device.
-  Helps the user to provide commands to the processor and also for the processor to receive data and information from it's environment.
Ex: keyboards, microphones, mouse, scanner, digital camera

**Output Devices,**
- Uses to output information to the user.
Ex: monitor, speaker, printer

*There are certain devices have the functionality that fall into both input and output categories.*
*Ex: touch-screen*


### Storage Devices
ROM doesn't have enough capacity to store data.
RAM is volatile and looses data once the power is turned off.
Storage devices are used to store data permanently. 

- Previously data was stored in 'punch cards'(a card with hole punched represent 1s and 0s) before the invention of magnetic and optical storage devices.
- In early days, magnetic tapes was used to store data but it had to be accessed in a sequential manner. 
- The introduction of hard disk and floppy disk made it possible for data to be stored and accessed randomly. 
	The hard disk was not meant to be portable since they were fragile and prone to strong vibration. Potable magnetic storages like floppy disks had a very limited storage capacity. 
- As a solution to these issues, ZIP disk was introduced with over 100mb.
- And the invention of the optical storages like CDs, DVDs store data on a disk which were not affected by magnetic fields, was easier to transport and cost effective. 
	CD can store data up to 700mb
	DVD can store data up to 4.2GB
	Blu-ray can store data up to 27GB
- Since all those solution was large in size, new memory solution like flash-drives, SD cards were invented later. 

### Expansion cards and other components
In order to have a functional computer, we have a way to integrate the processor, memory, input/output devices and storage devices together. These components have to placed on the "Main-board" or the "Mother-board".

Some additional circuit boards may be required to integrate additional devices if they are not already embedded into the motherboard. These circuit boards commonly referred to as "cards". These are plugged into the expansion slots on the motherboard. These cards provide expansion to the motherboard and the ability to connect other input, output and storage devices.
Ex: VGA cards, Sound cards, Ethernet cards, ...etc.

### Power Supply
- Component that powers up the computer.
- Takes in 110V or 230V and converts it into voltages ranging from -12V to +12V.
**Power Connectors,**
1. Mini plug - provide power to the floppy drive.
2. Molex power connector - provide power to the hard drives, CD/DVD drives and SCSI(Small Computer System Interfaces) drives.
3. Motherboard power connector - can be vary according to the form factor of the motherboard. primary task is to power up the motherboard.
4. 12V ATX power connector - provide additional power to the processor. plugged in to motherboard.
5. SATA(Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) power connector - provide power to the SATA hard drives.
