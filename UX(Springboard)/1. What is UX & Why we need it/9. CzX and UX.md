As a regular resident of a neighborhood, a city, a state or a country, we regularly have to go to what we call a "Citizen experience".

Citizen Experience refers to all the touchpoints including direct, indirect, controllable or uncontrollable.

Ex:
	paying a speeding ticket.
	hospitals
	schools
	renewal of driving licenses.

As citizens, we will encounter with hundreds of such experiences throughout our life. 
These touchpoints can happen through different communication channels, such as in person, on the phone, by email or online.
In other words, omnichannel idea applies very well to this reality of citizen experience. 

In order to satisfy their constituents, to balance their budget, to accomplish their promises to basically get re-elected, public servants need to rake into account their fellow citizens in their many experience with the government.

UX becomes especially handy when it is time to improve the touchpoints involving a technological artifacts such a a website or a self-service technology. 

Governments are becoming increasingly interested in the concept of citizen experience and UX in general. There are plenty of examples across the globe shows a new focus towards using technologies to improve experience of citizens. 
Ex: 
	Citizen Shops from Portugal Lab X
	UK government Digital Services
	Chili's LabGob
