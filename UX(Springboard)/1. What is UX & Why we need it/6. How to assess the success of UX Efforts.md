KPI = Key Performance Indicators
KPI represents a metric that is of strategically importance to a focal entity.

**Explanation:**
1. KPI is a metric that we use to measure the performance of UX.
2. KPI is strategically important because it is essential to focus on performance indicators that are foremost and really essential.  
3. KPI is specific to an entity, which can be of many different kinds. Such as an organization, a government or even a person.

Because KPIs are chosen, they often vary across entities. 
Ex: If two retailers compete in the same industry, one may choose to focus on customer loyalty KPIs while other may focus on cost-effectiveness KPIs.

KPIs can be organized in three categories,
	1. End-User level
	2. Organizational level
	3. Project level

#### End-User Level KPIs
End-user KPIs are metric that translate user's behaviours, cognitions and feelings into numbers. they are linked user's interactions with a particular digital product or service. 
They help UX professionals to capture performance in the aspect of the user experience at it's most direct essential level. 

End user KPIs can be split into two subgroups,
	1. Behavioral 
	2. Attitudinal

**Behavioral KPIs :**
When choosing behavioral KPIs, you have to think about the two or three most important tasks that you want your end user to accomplish during their interaction with your product. 
Ex:
	Filling a form on a website
	completing a transaction
	sending an information request and etc.
Choices of these tasks are what you end-user wants.

Examples for behavioral KPIs,
- Task Success Rate : number of correctly executed tasks 
	In an e-commerce platform, by monitoring the 'conversion rate', you can identify the problems related to the checkout process. 
	(An ecommerce conversion rate isÂ **the percentage of website visitors who purchased something from your online store**.)
- Time on task 
- Error rate
	Both these above KPIs accounts for users efficiency at completing task.

**Attitudinal KPIs :**
Attitudinal KPIs enables capturing end users internal states.
Ex: 
	1. You may want to ask end users how satisfied they are from interacting with your digital product or service. 
	2. You may also want to monitor a metric called the "net promoter score" which assesses the likelihood that your end user recommend your digital product to others.

#### Organizational level KPIs
End user level KPIs are important because they have very direct consequences in  term of user repeated behaviour and also for the organizational success.

Ex: Customer satisfaction is an important KPI for many enterprises because it leads to more customer loyalty thus enabling stronger and more profitable business. 

Choice of end user KPIs and their connection to business KPIs such as sales, growth, customer retention. profitability... is absolutely essentials because it will provide you most fundamental navigation tools to help you move your UX efforts in the direction that you have chosen, avoid taking wrong turns and benchmark yourself against you competitors or your previous efforts. 

#### Project Level KPIs
(within UX projects)

Success in the context of a project aimed to design a new digital product or service can be captured in terms of three categories,
	1. Quality (Quality of the product)
	2. Cost (money invested in the project)
	3. Time (time it takes to bring the product or service to market.)

Involving the user early in the development cycle helps reduce requirements uncertainty and leads to designing products and service that offer better fit  with what users desire.

UX project professionals will want to monitor and hope to decrease the number of time-consuming change requests that will pop up during the later stages of development. 
Detecting usability issues early in the development cycle an cost one hundred times less to fix compared to detecting them later on.
