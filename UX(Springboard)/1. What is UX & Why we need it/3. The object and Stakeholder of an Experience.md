Experience always involve an object and a stakeholder.
### The object
An experience is always in relationship with an object of some sort. 
This object 
	can be a physical artifact such as an app on your phone, 
	it can be a technology without a physical interface such as a vocal assistant, 
	it can be a another person such a customer representative
	or any form of touchpoint with a company or a government.

All these objects generate and experience.

### Stakeholders
Experience also involve human stakeholder or any form of being, as a matter of facts, who will interact with a given object generating an experience. 

This stakeholder may be a student, an employee, a customer, a mother, a kid, a citizen, a gamer or a healthcare patience or even a pet. 

By referring to the intersection of the stakeholders and the objects, we can correctly identify the different types of experiences.

UX(user experience) typically covers the intersections with all types of stakeholders and a given non-technology artifact or a technological artefact. 

Customer Experience(CX), Citizen Experience(CZX) or Employee Experience(EX) also focus on specific object of interest. 

In this course, we focus on the how the user experience applies to business solutions. In this context we will focus on technological artifacts that are the objects of an experience. 
Ex: 
	We will not be covering concepts of industrial designs related to the development of non-technological objects
	We will not focus on the design of conversational scripts with customer service representatives.
