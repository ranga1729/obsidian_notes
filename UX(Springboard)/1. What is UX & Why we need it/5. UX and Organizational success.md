### Why UX Matters
Being empathetic to users, benefits the process of designing digital solutions and also it has some business vales as end goal. 

For a example, if a digital solution is crafted in a was that fits user needs very well and if users' interactions with it result in a highly satisfying experience. then users are likely to use it, reuse it and recommend it to others, all of which are very first important steps towards generating business values.

"If the user is having a problem, it's our problem."
"The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we'll have."
"You've got to start with the customer experience and work back toward the technology - not the other way around."
	- Steve Jobs

I Google's philosophy statement, the exact words of its very first role are the following,
"Focus on users and all else will follow."

Description,
	"Since the beginning we have focused on providing the best user experience possible whether we are designing a new internet browser or a new tweak to the look of the home page, we take great care to ensure that they will ultimately serve you, rather than our internal goal or bottom line."

Several studies have demonstrated that the focus on user experience is consistently and tightly connected to tangible business indicators such as 
	growth, 
	market share, 
	brand recognition,
	customer acquisition and retention.

Studies,
1. A 2018 Forrester study, commissioned by Adobe provided extensive evidence that it pays off across industries to be an experience-driven business. 
	Ex: 
		Average revenue growth rate for experience-driven business was 15% in comparison to 11% for other surveyed companies.

		These business reported 1.6 times higher growth in brand awareness than their counterparts and their number of newly acquired customers was found to be 1.9 times the rate of other companies. 
		When it comes to customer retention, experience-driven business were doing 1.5 times better than the other companies.

2. An earlier study conducted by Forrester research by surveying more than a hundred firms has found a strong positive correlation between customer experience and customer intention to make additional purchases(essence of loyalty.)

"The positive impacts of UX is crystal clear: the more satisfied your users are, the more likely they are to do whatever it is that you are encouraging".
