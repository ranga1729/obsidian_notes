Customer Experience(CX) can be defined as all the interactions that a customer has with the brand. 
Ex: 
	Face to face interaction with a service employee (direct)

- CX and UX collaborate on delivering the brand service offerings.
- CX is a omnichannel experience and UX is the digital touch point experience. 
- CX is concerned about the relationship to their customers during the transactional process and UX is concerned about the relationship during the design process. The design process learns from the transactional experience like what works and what doesn't work, iterates improvements.

The concept of "customer journey" is a way to regroup all the touchpoints that and individual can experience with an organization or a brand. 
In UX, these touchpoints are typically categorized like,
	1. Before the purchase
	2. During the purchase
	3. After the purchase

Firms want to make this journey through all touchpoints as easy and enjoyable as possible for their customers.

There are many elements that can influence the CX. Some are controlled by the firm.
Ex: 
	product price
	retail atmosphere
	service interface
	product assortment
There are some elements that can not be controlled by the firm,
Ex: 
	social environment
	customer experience in alternative channels
	retail brand
	customer goals
	the economic climate
	online reviews

So, not all components of an experience are controllable. We have to identify the most important touchpoints that an organization or a brand can control so we can enhance an experience as much as we can. 

As you can see, there is some overlap between UX and CX, especially when the object of the experience is technological.

Ex: 
	When the customer uses a brand website to get an information
	when the customer is using in-store technologies 
	when the customer is writing an online review about his experience

Outcomes of good customer experience is a high level of satisfaction, which should lead to a strong sense of loyalty and engagement, which is synonyms with profitability.
