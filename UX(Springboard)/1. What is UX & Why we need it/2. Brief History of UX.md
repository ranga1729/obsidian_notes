Concept of UX is only 20 years old.

- UX has roots go back to the history of 'ergonomics'.
- One of the first UX insight was done during the second world war. Weapons and planes have greatly evolved during this time requiring more attention and less time to analyze form pilots. It was very common for perfectly functional planes driven by the best pilot to crash  because of human error. In 1943, and American lieutenant **Al Chapanis**, who was to become a pioneer of human factors, established that the so called **"pilot error"** could be considerably reduced when more logical and distinguishable controls replaced confused cockpit designs.  
- In 1960, we saw technical developments that eventually fueled interface ergonomics/graphical user interface, by **"Ivan Sutherland"**. 
- At the same time and also in California, **"Douglas Engelbart"** invented the mouse.
- End of the 70's we have the personal computers.
- At Palo Alto Xerox PARC the desktop icons and other graphical user interfaces were developed. 
- Even though all that happened, computers had CLI at that time. So, computers were used by experts. As a result, the early 80's saw a significant effort by several ergonomists and cognitive psychologists to make the personal computer accessible to non-experts. So, the concept of **"Usability"** came out in 1985. 
	Usability: an interface should be "Usable" in a specific context to help the user achieve his/her goal with efficiency, effectiveness and satisfactions. 
- Usability and its best practices were put in place in 80's, slowly. At the same time we started to refer to user-centered design. With the publication of **Don Norman's** books **"The psychology of Everyday Things"** in 1996, the idea of putting people at the center of our digital products and systems is starting to make its way. 
- As a result of that, the most advanced computer companies of the time, programmers began to work side by side with,
	1. expert in cognitive ergonomics to evaluates the usability of interfaces and a
	2. UI(user interface) designer who knew the rules and best practices of human-centered designs.

- In 90's computers became familiar in homes rather than workplaces and internet became so popular and non-work related contexts came out. To meet this need, we go from 'design the interface' to 'design the experience'. We move *from UI to UX*.
	The term "User Experience" appeared in 1995, also attributed to Don Norman.
	The idea here was to go beyond the interaction between a user and a computer screen, to consider the broader contextual factors that are likely to have and impact on the human-computer interactions.

- UX research was established at that time and today UX teams are consist of not only Programmers, Cognitive ergonomist and UI designer, but also Ethnographers and Psychologists.
	 ![[Pasted image 20240107142554.png]]Qualitative approaches were used to understand the "why" behind choices, preferences and habits of users. Armed with this information and loads of empathy for the users, the designers started conceiving experiences and thus became "UX Designers".
Ex: 
Mobile devices first came as big chunky phones, then iPods and in 2007 smart phone started to dominate the world.

Every time someone visits a digital touch point, they leave a trace. Their clicks can be accounted for. With this information, we know,
	1. What they looked at.
	2. how they went to buy their visits.
	3. if they concluded the transactions of if they left the transactional channel before they reach the end. 
This analytical data tells a lot about the frictional points with a particular website or applications. From this fine-grain knowledge of the actual experience, UX has evolved in two ways,
	1. First, UX experts will consult on the analytics before launching into a project, to be aware of the actual state of the user's experience. Since we have this fine grain information of where the friction points are on the site, UX evaluation experts have added new tools to measure the experience in real time.

	2. They are now using measures of sweat, heart rate, facial muscle activity, eye movement and electrical brain activity using techniques including skin conductance, pupillometry, eye tracking and magnetic brain imagery.

		The inclusion of physiological and neuro scientific techniques has advanced UX research by providing insights into often unconscious mechanism underlying user behavior. These techniques give us information about specific area of a webpage, allowing the design team to correct the frictional points.

But these technologies doesn't push away the use of qualitative research. Qualitative research is used to learn 'why people do what they do'. And physio neuro techniques help us understand the impacts of specific design choices that have been made. 

The broadening of the UX field experience explains why there are so many different expertise under the UX umbrella today. So we still have,
	1. UX experts, who evaluate and test the interfaces to be corrected before a project and those that are in progress until they are launched. These evaluation experts now have a broader palette of tools they use, from basic heuristic to high-tech physiological techniques. 
	2. UX experts, doing research sharing what they have observed with the design team, which is made in part of UX designers.
	3. Furthermore some of the UX practitioners participate in the team that oversees the creation and maintenance of the omni-channel service. 
This great team is under the guidance of CX(Customer Experience) expert, who often stems for marketing. They plays a strategic role.
