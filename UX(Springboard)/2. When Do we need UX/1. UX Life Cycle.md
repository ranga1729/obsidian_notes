Process of UX Design,
	1. Analyze
		Researching about the user experience and checking on other parameters of the project before looking for a solution. 
	2. Design
		Conceiving new or renewed user experience.
		This steps delivers the concept of the solutions.
	3. Prototype
		Develop the first draft of the upcoming interface and prototyping the experience.
		This step delivers the artifacts of the solution. 
	4. Evaluate
		Test every step of the process keeping the teams eye on the user's experience. 

This process is very scalable and iterative in some situations.
Therefore, some sections of this process may repeat and connect to others in the less predictive way.
