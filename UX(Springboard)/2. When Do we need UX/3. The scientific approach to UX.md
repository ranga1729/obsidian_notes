UX is a practice that can count on a rich toolbox of methods and techniques. These methods are just to get the result we want.
Each of these techniques is rooted in a proper scientific approach. Some have been borrowed from,
	social science
		ethnography
		sociology
		psychology
	natural science 
		neurology
		cognitive science

#### What is Scientific research ?
It is a type of research that is controlled an empirical. 
It is guided by theories and hypothesis about the presume relationship between elements. 

Ex: 
	Gestalt law of grouping suggesting that objects that are near or proximate to each other tend to be grouped together.

If we need to apply this theory into a UX research, we may want to perform a scientific research to test what is the minimal distance on an interface between two different functionalities for them to be perceived ad different. In order to perform this research, a scientific approach would be followed.

#### What is Scientific approach ?
It starts with the formulation or a problem to be solved. 
It is then followed by a conceptual phase where the scientist use reasoning to arrive at hypothesis to test. 
The next step is empirical testing. This will lead to resolve that may or may not support the proposed hypothesis. 
Results may help re-think the problem formulation, the proposed hypothesis or even the testing method. 
Once modified, scientist test again until they arrive at an empirical supported explanation of the observed natural phenomena. 

The test process used needs to be reproduced in the scientific method. 

The literature suggest that they are four methods of knowing,
	1. Tenacity
	2. Authority
	3. Intuition
	4. Science

**Tenacity**
	"Having firm beliefs.
	If faced with a conflicting fact, people consider it to be false."
Ex: People believed earth is flat.

**Authority**
	Ex: If a doctor mentioned to his patient that he has a certain illness, the patient will usually belief it because the doctor is an expert in his filed.

**Intuition**
	"If a fact seems reasonable, people would be inclined to believed it."

**Science**
	If the hypothesis is not confirmed, the empirical test process continues until the problem is resolved. An the test results are reproducible.
