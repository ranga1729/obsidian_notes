Don't confuse the UX design process with IT Project management phases. don't assume these processes are interchangeable. But they can work together.

In the user centered design process, there are number of techniques used in each phase. This is the way those techniques map out to the UX life cycle.

#### Analyze phase(Discover)
Two types of activities in this section,
	1. Gathers information about the context and boundaries of the project such as 
		Problem definition 
		UX design brief
		Secondary research
		UX benchmark
		Stakeholder interviews
		Consulting analytics
		Heuristic evaluation of existing interfaces. 
	2. Collects user data informing the upcoming design phase.
		Recruiting participants
		Qualitive and Quantitative research technique such as user interviews, observation, focus groups, surveys, cultural probes.
		With these data, we create personas, experience maps, journey maps, empathy map and service design blueprint...
#### Design phase(Define)
The design phase includes
	The vision workshop
	Design thinking
	Brainstorming techniques
	Co-design and participatory design
	Storytelling/storyboarding

#### Prototype phase(Develop)
Covers UI design in this section. Other than that, this section includes,
	Persuasive design
	Gamification
Once the actual prototyping starts, 
	card sorting
	paper prototyping
	wireframing 
	high fidelity prototyping

### Evaluate(Deploy)
There is wide array of evaluation techniques to match every step of the UX project as well as every feedback needs for the different kinds of information. 
Testing methods,
	Guerilla mode(lab testing)
	Heuristic evaluation
	Use testing
	A/B testing
	Self-assessment surveys
	
These data imply knowledge about usability scales, emotions and cognition.
For finer knowledge of user experience, we use physiological measurements such as,
	eye tracking
	pupillometry
	electrodermal activity
	heart rate
	neurological measurements
