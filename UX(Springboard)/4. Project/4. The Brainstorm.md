Now you need to generate idea on how to address the insight that you just produced in the previous step.

To do that, you need to chose a stakeholder.
(Whom you are working for and who will take advantage of this insight.)
This stakeholder can be anything as long as it related to some degree to your user's experience. 

After finding the stakeholder, complete this sentence,

> [!NOTE]
> How might we as ...................(your stakeholder/organization)
> take advantage of ......................................(insight)
> to deliver ................................(identified need)
> to ...................................(user).

Now you need to draw your ideas on paper.
The idea is to draw a maximum of ideas in response to the insights that you have identified in the previous step.

An idea is the equivalent of a type of interaction.
For instance, if your user is always hungry when commuting, perhaps find a way to let him know where he can find his favourite foods while on his way. On the other hand a traffic app that also shows the weather and sends suggestions from co-workers would comprise three ideas.

Ex:
#1 - Commuting Rideshare

#2 - Hitchhike a ride

#3 - A transit app

#4 - Gym/Commute combo

#6 - The beat

#7 - Silly AR

#8 - Social Hear rate related interactions

Now it's time to share your ideas and get feedback from the users. 
First explain the angle you have chosen and whom you're working for. Then over the next five minutes, you present each of your ideas to your user and listen to their feedback. 

The goal here is to get their reaction, good and bad, What do they think about your ideas ?, Do they meet user needs ?
