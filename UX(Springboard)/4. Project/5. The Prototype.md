Focus on one solution and get closer to making it real.
Based on the feedbacks from your user regarding your ideas, You know what they liked in your brainstorm. 
May be one idea has clearly emerged from the discussion, may be many elements from several idea were deemed interesting. 
This stage is about focusing, synthesizing the interesting elements into a single solution. 

#### Low-fi prototyping (low fidelity)
Use a prototyping application to develop a prototype/sketch of your solution/mobile application.

Share your solution again with your solution. 
Make a list of what works and does not work from your solution, from your user's perspective. 

#### Building a High Fidelity prototype
Once we have established what the solution and interaction could be, if the categories of features and information you proposed fit their mental model and you have tested it, this would be the time to move to wireframes in order to decide the visual design and develop interactive high fidelity prototypes. 

With High fidelity prototypes we can test the interface in finer details. 
Over the iterations we would move to increasingly more sophisticated testing methods to eliminate all usability issues and friction points.
