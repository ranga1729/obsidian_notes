You should consider your user's experience through a particular point of view, one angle that deserves to be explored. 
To help you identify this point of view, we suggest you proceed through these fill in the blanks phrases. 

First,
"It is interesting/surprising that he/she .........................................".

Then,
"The thing that looks most important to him/her is ..............................."

Now come up with an insight. An insight means a information that has not necessarily been expressed by the participant, but that you identify as key to understand their experience. 

"I'm wondering if this means that ....................."

Now summarize your analysis by completing this last phrase(adjust the syntax if needed.)

> [!NOTE]
> In my opinion, ...........................(name or description of your user)
> needs a solution for .........................(the need you have identified)
> because ...................................(the insight you've identified).

For better results, identify several opinions.
