#### The Commuting Experience

We all commute at some point. Some travel by car, others by public transport. Some prefer cycling, while others walk to work or school.

We have information and entertainment needs while _on the go_. Over the years, a large number of mobile apps have popped-up to meet this need. Applications for public transport, podcast apps, music streaming apps; all of these apps make our lives easier and our commutes, more enjoyable. However, there is still room for improvement!

All you need at this point is a pencil and some paper. _And a user!_

Before getting into the designing phase, we must have details about the scenario or the situation to analyze the problem. 

Starting with what we know is not the 'User centered designing process.'
Instead, as UX designers, we need to turn to our user to get insight on their needs and behaviors. We want to keep the user in the loop to be empathic abut their needs and to generate rich insight to feed the design process.
