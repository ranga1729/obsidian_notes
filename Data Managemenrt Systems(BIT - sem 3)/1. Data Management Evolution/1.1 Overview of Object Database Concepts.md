As *Relational Databases* are built on *Relation Data Model*, ==Object Databases are built on Object Data Model.== (aka Object-Oriented Databases or OODB)
Major importance of object data model,
1. Flexibility to determine the structure of the **objects**.
2. Flexibility to determine the relevant **operations** of the object. 

Object databases are used to serve Real time applications and information systems such as,
1. Telecommunication 
2. Architectural Designing
3. Biological science applications
4. Geographical Information Systems(GIS) 
which require high performance and speed calculations.

Applications developed with Object-Oriented Languages facilitate the seamless integration with application developed using object oriented languages. 
	Sometimes applications developed with OOP languages(ex: C++, Java) meet conflicts when use the traditional databases. 

There are some RDBMS include the features of object databases, known as **Object-Relational Databases**.
