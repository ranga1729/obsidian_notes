### 1. Creating a class (Instantiating)
```C++
class Person {
	//include your code here
	//you can include variables(members) and also member functions(methods) here
	public:
		string name;
		int age;
	
	void describe() {
		cout << name << " is " << age << " years old." << endl;
	}
};
```
- should start with the keyword `class`
- First character of the name better to be capital. `Person`
- Code should be include within a curly bracket.
- Class should be end with a `;` semicolon.

- Class is a template for a object. 
### 2. To access the class
```C++
int main() {
	Person p;
	p.name = "Ranga";
	p.age = "21";
	p.describe();
}
```

- "Dot notation" is used to access members variables and method in the class.
- `Person` is the class, `p` is the object. ("Instance" is another name for a object.)

### 3. Access modifiers
Three main access modifiers,
	1. public
	2. private (default)
	3. protected
public : you can access the members of the class from the outside of the class.
private : Not accessible from the outside of the class.
protected : only child classes can directly access

**If you haven't mentioned the access modifier, compiler consider them as private.
Ex: 
```C++
class Example {
	int NIC;
	public:
	string name;

	//NIC is a private variable while name is public.
};
```

### 4. setters / getters
This is where we practically implement "Encapsulation" in our code. 
The idea of encapsulation is, prevent accessing the inner working of a program.

If our member variables/ methods in the class is in public, first we need to set the to the private or protected. 
Then we can implement separate functions to set values to those variables(setters/mutators) and return values of those variables(getters/accessors). 

```C++
class Person {
	private:
		string name;
		int age;
		
	public:
		//public constructor is working here.
		//setters
		void setName(string name) {
			this -> name = name;
		}
		void setAge(int age) {
			this -> age = age;
		}

		//getters
		string getName() {
			return name;
		}
		int getAge() {
			return age;
		}
	
		void describe() {
			cout << name << " is " << age << " years old." << endl;
		}
}
```
Now we can modify the out `main` method to work with encapsulation.
```C++
int main() {
	//object declaration with a default constructor
	Person p;

	//setting up vales to member variables through setters
	p.setName("Ranga");
	p.setAge(21);

	//getting values of the member variables through getters
	cout << p.getName << endl;
	cout << p.getAge << endl;
	
	//member function accessing
	p.describe();
	return 0;
}
```

### 5. Constructors
- "Constructors" are a special kind of method that we use to assign values to a object initially. 
- Two types of constructors,
	1. Default Constructor
	2. Custom Constructor
- If we don't implement a "Custom Constructor" of our own, the compiler will create a "Default Constructor". 
- If we implement ourself a constructor, the default constructor will no longer working. 

*Default constructor generates defaults values like 0, null and fill them in to members variables for us. If we create a Custom constructor, it doesn't fill default values for us, we have to manually assign values when we create/initiate an object. 
Ex: 
	Default constructor: Person p;
	Custom constructor: Person p("Ranga", 21);

**After assigning initial values to our object using a constructor, then we use setters to change initial values and getter to get the values of those variables, because we can't direct access those member variables since encapsulation is achieved in this code example.**

Rules of creating a Constructors,
	1. Constructors do not return values.
		Before I mentioned that constructor is a special kind of method. Methods have a return type, Name and parameters.
		But Constructors don't have return types since they don't return any data. 
		```Person(string ame, int age)```
	2. Constructor name should be the class name. 
	3. Constructor should be public. 

```C++
class Person {
	private:
		//member variables
		string name;
		int age;
		
	public:
		//custom construtor
		Person(string name, int age) {
			this -> name = name;
			this -> age = age;
		}
		//public construcotr
		Person() = default;

		//setters
		void setName(string name) {
			this -> name = name;
		}
		void setAge(int age) {
			this -> age = age;
		}

		//getters
		string getName() {
			return name;
		}
		int getAge() {
			return age;
		}

		//methods
		void describe() {
			cout << name << " is " << age << " years old." << endl;
		}
}
```

```C++
int main() {
	//object declaration with a custom constructor
	Person p("Ranga", 21)
	//member function accessing
	p.describe();
	
	return 0;
}
```

OR you can use this shortcut syntax to create a custom constructor,
`class_name(data_type parameter_1,....): member_var1(param_1),...{}``
Ex:
```C++
Person(string first, int age): first(first), last(last) {}
```

Code for the default constructor,
```C++
Person() = default;
```
### 6. Inheritance
We can make a new class that derives features(methods, variables) from a previously created class. Using this concepts we can create a hierarchy of classes. 
- Bass class : Top class of the hierarchy. Every class inherits from this class.
- Super/Parent class  : Derived classes inherit features from this class.
- Child/Sub class : derived class.
To achieve this, we use `:` ,
Ex: 
```C++
class Employee : public Person {
	//include code here
};
```

Now `Employee` class inherits features from the `Person` class.

```C++
int main() {
	Person p("Ranga", 21);

	Employee e;
	e.setName = "Kasun";
	e.setAge = 22;
}
```

- **The reason why we have to use `public Person` is , when a class inherits from a previous class, all the public public assets in the previous class become private in the new class. To solve this issue, we use `public` keyword when initiating a inherited class.**

- **Constructors doesn't inherit unless you say so.**
- We can add specific features to employee in that class.

When we create new member variables and a custom constructor for our new class, we have to pass inherited values to the parent/super class's constructor and assign new member variable's values to it's constructor.
Ex:
```C++
class Person
{
	private: 
		string name;
		int age;
	public:
		//custom constructor in shortcut
		Person(string name, int age) : name(name), age(age) {}

//inherited class
class Employee : public Person
{
	private:
		bool married;
	public:
	//assign name, age to the person class's constructor and married to this class.
		Employee(string name, int age, bool married) : Person(name, age), married(married) {}
}
```


### 7. Function Overriding 
Function overriding means, Redefining functionality of Base class into Derived class. 
Ex: 
```C++
class Base
{
	public:
		void msg()
		{
			cout << "Base Class" << enl;
		}
};

class Derived:public Base
{
	public:
		void msg()
		{
			cout << "Derived class" << endl;
		}
};
```

In this example,
- We have modified the `msg()` function in the Base class into the Derived class.
- Both function signatures are similar. 

```C++
int main()
{
Base b;
b.msg(); //output = "Base class"

Derived c;
c.msg(); //output = "Derived class"
}
```
Even though Derived class inherit the `msg()` function the Base class, it doesn't run the msg function in the Base class when we call it. 
Derived class runs the `msg()` in the Derived class. This is Function overriding. 

If you want to run the Base class's `msg()` function in a Derived class's object,
```C++
class Derived:public Base
{
	public:
		void msg()
		{
			Base::msg();
		}
};
```
```C++
int main()
{
Derived c;
c.msg(); //output = "Base class"
}
```
- `::` is known as "Scope Resolution".

### 8. Function Overloading
function overloading is having multiple function with different,
	1. number of parameters
	2. different types of parameters
but with the same name. 

Ex:
```C++
int add(int x, int y) {
	return x+y;
}

int add(int x, int y, int z) {
	return x+y+z;
	
float add(float x, float y) {
	return x+y; 
}

string add(string x, string y) {
	return x + " " + y;
}
```
In this example, we have 3 functions with the same name, but return types and parameter count is different. 

- Program will identify which function to call based on the data types and the parameter count we provided when calling the function. 
	`add(10, 5) ` will call the 1st add function.
	`add("Ranga", "Bandara")` will call the last function.

### 9. Up Casting / Down Casting

#### Up Casting
Upcasting is converting a derived-class reference or a pointer to a base-class. 
In other words, it is the process of treating a derived class object as a base class object.
It is always allowed for public inheritance, without an explicit type cast. 
This is a result of the relationship between base and derived classes.

***Syntax :***
```C++
Derived d;
Base *ptrB = &d; 
```

***Ex :***
```C++
class Animal {
	public: 
		virtual void makeSound() {}
};
class Dog : public Animal {
	public:
		void makeSound() override {
			cout << "Woof!" << endl;
		}
};

int main() {
	Dog dog;
	//upcast the dog object to an Animal object.
	Animal *animal = &dog;
	//call the makeSound() method on the Animal object. 
	animal -> makeSound(); //output = "Woof!"
return 0;
}
```
#### Down Casting
Down casting is converting a base-class pointer/reference to a derived-class. (Opposite of upcasting)
Down casting is not allowed without an explicit type cast. The reason for this restriction is base-derived relationship isn't symmetric. A derived class could add new member variables and member functions that wouldn't apply to the base class.
![[Pasted image 20230929131745.png]]
when we try to do downcast in the previous way that we did upcasting, it will show an error.
To in this situation we use **Dynamic Casting**.

### 10. Dynamic Casting
Dynamic casting is primarily used to safely downcast; convert a base class pointer/reference to a derived class pointer.  
In other words, it is the process of treating a base class object as a derived class object.

***Syntax :***
```C++
Derived obj = new Base();
Derived *ptr = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(&obj); 
```

***Ex :***
```C++
class Animal {
	public: 
		virtual void makeSound() {}
};
class Dog : public Animal {
	public:
		void bark() {
			cout << "Woof!" << endl;
		}
};

int main() {
	Animal *animal = new Dog();
	//downcast the animal object to a dog object using dynamix casting
	Dog *dog = dynamic_cast<Dog*>(animal);
	//call the bark() method on the dog object.
	dog -> bark(); //output = "Woof!"
	delete animal;
return 0;
}
```
