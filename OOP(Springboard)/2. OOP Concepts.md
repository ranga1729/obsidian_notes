### What is an object ?
An object is a thing from real word.
Ex: 
	a car , a book
	a dental appointment, a bank account
In OOP, an object is anything of interest to the software application that you are building or anything you want to store and process data about.
Another name for an object : an entity.

fundamentals of OOP,
	1. Abstraction
	2. Encapsulation
	3. Inheritance
	4. Polymorphism

### 1. Abstraction
Abstraction means simplify the reality. 
Ex
	A person is an object. 
	When designing a new application to process data about a person you don't need to be interested in everything there is to know about a person, rather you only have to concern about the data that are relevant and the tasks that you want to perform with those data.

### What is a Class ?
A class is a template for creating an object. It's a code written by a programmer to define the attributes and the operations of an object.

**Attributes(fields/properties)** describe the object. They are coded within the class either as public variables or as property procedures.
**Operations(behaviors/methods)** are actions can be done to or performed by the object. Methods are coded as as procedures or functions.

Once a class is written, it can be used to create many objects of the same type.
Ex: 
	Person p1;
	Person p2;
Since that, Class is sometimes referred as a type.
Each object is an instance of  a class in the computer's memory. Creating an object from a class is therefore known as **"Instantiation"**.

Once these objects have been created, their properties can be assigned values, making each object of the same type a unique entity.
Ex: 
	p1.name = "Steve Rogers";
	p1.age = 80; 
	p1.powers = true;
	p1.speciality = "Strength";
	-
	p2.name = "Tony Stark";
	p2.age = 40;
	p2.powers = false;
	p2.speciality = "Rich and genius"
	
- Each property is defined in the class by a property procedure which may include a code to validate a property value while it's being assigned. 
	This ensure the integrity of the data contained within the object.
- All the property values assigned to an object, are collectively known as the state of the object. 
- It's also possible to assign values to properties while an object is being instantiated by suing "New" and constructors. 
	Ex:
	Person p3 = New Person("Bruce Banner",45, true, "Big and green");

### 2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation means to hide the complexity of the inner working of an object from the programs and the programmers that make use of it or referred to as information hiding because the data contained within an object and the functions that manipulate the data are bound together(safe from outside interference). 

### 3. Inheritance
This simply means, a class can derives its methods and properties from another class. Inheritance can cause an hierarchy of objects. 
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20230924223911.png]]

- An employee in a business is also a person, through inheritance an employee class derives it's methods and properties of the person class. An employee is a types of a person.
- Employee class also can be have some extra properties of methods of it's own.
- Manager, Programmer, Cleaner classes are also inherit from employee class.
	*Person Class --> Employee Class --> Manager, Programmer, Cleaner Classes*

- The class that start of the hierarchy of the inheritance called "the Base class".
- Any class that derives from another class is called a "Sub Class", any class that derives that is derived from is called "Super class"
	Ex:
	- Person is a Base class.
	- Employee is a sub/child class of person class.
	- Manager is a sub/child class of employee class.
	- Employee class is the Super/parent class of the manager class.

### 4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism means 'a class can implement an inherited methods in it's own way.' (polymorphism = many forms )

Ex:
	![[Pasted image 20230924225242.png]]
- Person class have method to store details in a database.
- Since inheritance all of subclasses of the person class now inherit that method.
- But It's better to store customer details in a separate database.
- Polymorphism allows the customer class to override the workings of any method or property, but it inherits the new version of it's own.
Different forms of the same type of objects with the same interface can behave in different ways.
