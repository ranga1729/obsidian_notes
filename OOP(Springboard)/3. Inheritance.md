Inheritance is used in OOP to,
	1. Reduce code redundancy 
	2. To achieve code reusability. 

Ex:
Both Four wheeler class and Two wheeler class has Color, Brand, Mileage variables.
Instead of repeating the same code in both classes, we can create a Base class called 'Vehicle' and implement those common variables in there. Then we can use inheritance to inherit those properties in to Four wheeler and Two wheeler classes.

### Modes of Inheritance
1. Public mode
	public member of the base/parent/super class remain public in the derived class and protected members will remain protected in the derived class.
2. Protected mode
	Both public and protected members of the base/parent/super class will be become protected in the derived class. 
3. Private mode
	Protected and public members of base/parent/super class will become private in the derived class. 
*All private members are remain private in any mode.*

### Types of Inheritance
1. Single inheritance
2. Multiple inheritance
3. Multi-level inheritance
4. Hierarchical inheritance
5. Hybrid inheritance

### 1. Single Inheritance
There's a single derived class from a single base class. 
![[Pasted image 20230926143123.png]]
**Syntax:**
```C++
class derived_class_name : access_modifier base_class_name {
	//body
};
```
- Derived class objects can access the members of the base/parent/super class.
- Base/parent/super class can't access the derived class members. 

### 2. Multiple Inheritance
The derived class is inherited from more than one base classes.

**Syntax:**
```C++
class derived_class : access_mod base_class_1,access_mod base_class_2 {
	//body
};
```

### 3. Multi-level Inheritance
The derived class is inherited from another derived class. 
![[Pasted image 20230926143514.png]]
**Syntax:**
```C++
class base_class {
	//code
};

class derived_class_1 : access_mod base_class {
	//code
};

class derievd_class_2 : access_mod derived_class_1 {
	//code
}
```

### 4. Hierarchical Inheritance
More than one derived classes are inherited from a single base class. 
![[Pasted image 20230926143931.png]]
**Syntax:**
```C++
class base_class {
	//code
};

class derived_class_1 : access_mod base_class {
	//code
};

class derived_class_2 : access_mod base_class {
	//code
};

class derived_class_3 : access_mod base_class {
	//code
};
```

### 5. Hybrid Inheritance
Hybrid inheritance is implemented by combining more than one inheritance types. (In other words, combination of both multilevel and hierarchical inheritances.)
