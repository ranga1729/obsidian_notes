### What is polymorphism ?
Poly = many  |  morph = forms
	Polymorphism simply means, many forms.
- In OOP, when a member function or an object behaves in different manner under different circumstances, it's called polymorphism.

Ex: A mother plays different tole(forms) in the family. 
	She is a parent to to her children.
	She is a wife to her husband.
	She is a sister to her siblings. 
	She is a daughter to her parents.

### Types of Polymorphism

#### 1. Compile time Polymorphism
This type of polymorphism is achieved during the compile time.
This can be implemented by using,
	1. Function overloading
	2. Operator overloading

**Function Overloading***
Function overloading is a feature in C++ where function can have a same name with different types and different counts of parameters.
Ex:
```C++
int add(int x, int y) {
	return x+y;
}

int add(int x, int y, int z) {
	return x+y+z;
}
```

***Operator Overloading***
Operator overloading in C++ is a feature that allows programmers to define new meanings for existing operators. This can be useful for working with user-defined types, such as classes and structures.

#### 2. Runtime Polymorphism
This type of polymorphism is achieved when the function are called or invoked during the runtime.
- This can be achieved through the function overriding. 

**Function Overriding***
The functions with same name have different definitions in the parent class and child class. 
Ex:
```C++
class Parent
{
	void msg() {
		cout << "This is parent class.";
	}
};

class Child: public Parent
{
	void msg() {
		cout << "This is child class.";
	}
}; 
```

**Virtual Functions***
Virtual Functions are also used to achieve runtime polymorphism in C++.
A virtual function in C++ is a member function that is declared in a base class and can be overridden in derived classes. 
To declare a virtual function, you use the `virtual` keyword before the function declaration.
Ex:
```C++
class Animal 
{
	public:
		virtual void speak() {
			cout << "This is Base." << endl;
		}
		//this declares a virtual function
		//any class inherits from this class can override this function to provide its own implementation.
};

class Dog:public Animal
{
	public:
		void speak() override {
			cout << "Woof!" << endl;
		}
};

class Cat:public Animal
{
	public:
		void speak() override {
			cout << "Meow!" << endl;
		}
};

int main()
{
	Animal *a;
	Dog d;
	a = &d;
	a -> speak();
	//output = "Woof!"
}
```

In this example, we have assigned a Dog(derived) object into a Animal(base) pointer. Since we call the speak function using a base class, that should call the speak function of base class.
But since we used virtual functions there, Base class function will be always override by the derived class functions. 

- ***"Function overriding" is the process of redefining a function in a derived class that has the same signature as a function in the base class.***
- ***"Virtual functions" are functions in a base class that can be overridden in derived classes.***
