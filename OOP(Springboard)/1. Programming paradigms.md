**Programming Paradigm** is means the style or the standard way of writing a program. 

Using a programming paradigms we can,
	1. Decrease the complexity
	2. Improve the readability
	3. Improve the structure
	4. Makes it easy to test
	5. Makes it easy to change
	6. Makes sit easy to maintain

Main categories of programming paradigms are,
	1. Imperative Programming
	2. Declarative Programming


## 1. Imperative programming
Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements to change a program's state. In much the same way that the natural languages expresses commands, the imperative programming consist of command for the computer to be performed. 
**Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates step by step, rather than on high-level description of its expected results.**

It's one of the oldest programming paradigms and it's features close to machine architecture. It is based on **Von Neuman Architecture**. 
This paradigm divided into three broad categories,
	1. Procedural Programming
	2. Object Oriented Programing 
	3. Parallel Processing Approach

Advantages,
	1. Very simple to implement
	2. It contains loops, variables and etc...

Disadvantages,
	1. Complex problems cannot be solved
	2. Less efficient and less productive
	3. Parallel programming is not possible.
