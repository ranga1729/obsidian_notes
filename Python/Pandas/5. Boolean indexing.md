Boolean indexing in Pandas refers to the process of filtering data in a DataFrame or Series using Boolean conditions. 

When apply a Boolean condition to a DataFrame or a Series, it returns a Series of Boolean values that correspond to whether each element meets the condition. 
Ex:
```python
df = pd.DataFrame({ 
	'A': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 
	'B': [5, 15, 25, 35, 45] 
})
```

1. Let's Boolean index the `A` column for values less than or equal to 25

- Since we only index the `A` column, `condition` is in type of "Series" and it consist of Boolean values.

2. Let's Boolean index the whole DataFrame for values less than or equal to 25.

- Now it returns a DataFrame full of Boolean values indicating if each data element has satisfied the given Boolean expression or not. 

The returning Series/DataFrame after Boolean indexing is called the **"Boolean mask"**.

**Once we done with the Boolean indexing, we can use that Boolean Mask to filter out the values from the original DataFrame.**
```python
filtered_df = df[condition]
```

- It only returns the rows with only `A` has values less or equal to 25.

Let's take only rows with `A` has values greater than 25.

Let's take the only row with column `B` has value 35.

You can apply the condition and Boolean masking at the same time using this approach,
```python
filtered_df = df[df['A'] > 20]
```

******
##### Multiple Conditions
Multiple conditions can be applied using the logical operators(`&` for AND, `|` for OR)

Ex:
1. Selecting rows where column `A` is greater than 20 and column `B` is less than 40.
