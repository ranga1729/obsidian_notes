Used to apply a function or a mapping (like a dictionary) to each element of a Series. It is generally used for element-wise transformations and substitutions.

> [!NOTE] Important
> `map()` is applied only to Series objects, not DataFrames.
> It can take a function, a dictionary, or a Series as an argument.

Syntax:
```python
Series.map(arg, na_action=None)
```
- `arg`: The function, dictionary, or Series to be applied.
- `na_acrion`: Indicates what to do with `N/A` values.
	If set to ‘`ignore`’, it propagates N/A values without passing them to the mapping function.
*****
Ex: 
1. Applying a mathematical function to each element
```python
import pandas as pd

s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

s_mapped = s.map(lambda x: x ** 2)
print(s_mapped)
```

2. Mapping with a dictionary
```python
s = pd.Series(['cat', 'dog', 'rabbit'])

s_mapped_dict = s.map({'cat': 'kitten', 'dog': 'puppy'})

print(s_mapped_dict)
```

### `apply()` vs. `map()`
