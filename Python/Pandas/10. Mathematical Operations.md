Pandas allows you to perform mathematical operations on entire datasets with ease. These operations can be done using both Scalars and functions. 

#### Scalar
Scalar is a simple and straightforward single value. In mathematics, it's a single value like an integer or a float.
Ex: 
	5, 3.14, -1
These single values often used in more complex data structures like arrays or data frames.
#### Functions
A function is a block of codes that perform a specific task.
It takes inputs(arguments), process them and returns an output. 
Functions can operate on single values(like scalars or variables) or more complex data structures like DataFrames.
Ex: 
	`sum(a, b)`
	`max(a, b, c)`
