##### 1. Access a single column(Series)
Use `DataFrameName['ColumnName']` syntax to access a Series.

##### 2. Access a multiple columns(Series) at once
To access multiple column, you need to provide a list column names into the above syntax. 
Ex: If you want to access `A, C` columns the list of the columns names will be `['A', 'C']`. 
Then use the same syntax, `DataFrameName[listOfColumnNames]`
	`df[['A', 'C']]`

##### 3. `loc` method
`loc` method is **label-based**, which means it's used to select data by row and column labels(names/strings)
Syntax: 
```python
DataFrameName.loc[rowLable, columnLabel]
```
![[Pasted image 20241127100752.png]]

1. Selecting a single row by label
```python
df.loc['Alice']
```
![[Pasted image 20241127100853.png]]

2. Selecting multiple rows by labels
Provide the list of the row labels to the `loc` method.
```python
df.loc[['Alice, Bob']]
```

3. Selecting a range of rows by labels
```python
df.loc['Alice':'Charlie']
```
![[Pasted image 20241127101320.png]]

4. Selecting specific rows and columns by labels
Ex: Print Alice and Charlie's Scores.
```python
df.loc[['Alice', 'Charlie'], ['Score']]
```
![[Pasted image 20241127101805.png]]

5. Selecting all rows and specific columns
Ex: Print all player's scores.
```python
df.loc[:, ['Score']]
```

##### 4. `iloc` method
`iloc` method is **integer position-based**, which means it's used to select data by row and column indices.
Syntax: 
```python
DataFrameName.iloc[rowIndex, columnIndex]
```

![[Pasted image 20241127102308.png]]

1. Selecting a single row by index.
```python
df.iloc[0]
```
0th index is belongs to 'Alice',

2. Selecting multiple rows by indices.
Provide the list of row indices needs to be accessed.
```python
df.ilov[[0,2]]
```
0th and 2nd indices are belongs to 'Alice' and 'Charlie'
![[Pasted image 20241127102635.png]]

3. Selecting a range of rows by indices
```python 
df.iloc[0:2]
```
![[Pasted image 20241127103329.png]]

4. Selecting specific rows and columns by indices
```python
df.iloc[[0, 2], [1]]
```
Ex: 
	0th row index : 'Alice'
	2nd row index: 'Charlie'
	1st column index: 'Match' (not the 'Scores' because 1st Series is used as the index with `inplace=True`. So the 0th column index is 'Scores' and the 1st column index is 'Match')
	This will select Alice and Charlie's Match counts.

5. Selecting all rows and specific columns
```python
df.iloc[:, [1]]
```

*****
### Important
> [!NOTE] Inclusive vs. Exclusive
> When selecting a range, 
> `loc` is inclusive of both endpoints.
> `iloc` is exclusive of the top endpoint.

Ex:
`df.loc['Alice', 'Charlie']` includes 'Charlie'
`df.iloc[0:2]` includes rows at indices 0 and 1 but not 2.
