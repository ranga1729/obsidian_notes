PanDas stands for **"Panel Data System"** and it's an open-source data analysis and manipulation tool.
It's built on top of **Numpy** library.

Two primary data structures used in Pandas,
1. Series
2. DataFrames
#### Series
- A one-dimensional array like object(Imagine a vertical array).
- Able to hold any data type.
- Similar to a column in a Database table.
- Each element in a series is associated with an index(Used to uniquely identify elements). This index can be either a string or a number. 
#### DataFrames
- Similar to a table in a relational database.
- A tabular data structure comprised of rows and columns. 
- DataFrame can think of as a **group of Series** objects that share an index.

### Creating Series and DataFrames :-
##### 1. Create a Series from a list

##### 2. Creating a Series with custom index labels

##### 3. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary of lists
Python dictionary is a data structure that consist of key-value pairs.
Key can be used to identify each value and values can be any data type.

Here,
- All **A, B, C** key-value pairs were used as Series. 
- Index was auto-generated. `(0, 1, 2, 3)`
- Keys(`A,B,C`) considered as column names.
We can tell panda to use one a key-value pair as the index of the DataFrame instead of letting it generate automatically.

##### 4. Creating a DataFrame from a list of dictionaries

#### Additional :-
1. **set_index** function
`set_index` function is used to set one or more columns of a DataFrame as the index.

2. `inplace` parameter
The `inplace` parameter is a Boolean flag that determines whether the operation is performed on the original DataFrame and then return the original DataFrame or the modified DataFrame with changes.

- `dfT` DataFrame used `inplace=True` and it's index is shown as `Index(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`
	When `inplace=True`, index setting function will work on the original DataFrame and will return a modified DataFrame with changes.
- `dfF` DataFrame used `inplace=False`(Default) and it's index is shown as `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=4, step=1)`
	When `inplace=False`, index setting function will work on the original DataFrame but it will return the original DataFrame without changes.
