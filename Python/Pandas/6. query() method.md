This method allows to query data from a DataFrame using Boolean expression in a more readable and concise way compare to Boolean masking. 

Syntax,
```python
DataFrameName.query(expression, inplace=False, **kwargs)
```
- **`expression`**: The query string.(Should be a valid Boolean expression involving columns of the DataFrame)
- **`inplace`**: If `True`, filtering will be done in-place and the original DataFrame will be modified.
- **`**kwargs`**: Additional keyword arguments passed to the underlying `eval` function.

This method returns a new DataFrame with the rows that match the Boolean expression.

1. Querying a single column

2. Querying multiple columns

****
We can use Local Variable within our query string.

Colum names with spaces or special characters can still be used but need to be enclosed in backticks. `(``)` 
Ex:
```python
data = { 
	'A B': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 
	'C-D': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] 
}
```

### Additional :-
#### `eval` functions
The `eval` function in pandas is used to evaluate string expressions in the context of the calling DataFrame. 
==When you use the `query` method, pandas internally utilize the `eval` function to parse and execute the query string.==

Ex:
```python
data = { 
	'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 
	'B': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 
	'C': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500] 
} 
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
result = df.eval('D = A + B + C') 
print(result)
```

**Advantage of `eval`**
- `eval` can be faster than python's regular standard operators because it uses `numexpr` for efficient computation, especially with large DataFrames.
- It allows for concise and readable expressions without the need for looping or multiple lines of code.
- Ability to handle complex expressions involving multiple columns and operations.
**Warning**
	Since `eval` executes the string as code, ensure that the input strings are trusted and controlled to avoid code injection vulnerabilities.
