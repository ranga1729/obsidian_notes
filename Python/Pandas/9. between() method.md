This method is used to filter a DataFrame or a Series by selecting rows where the values fall within a specified range. 

Syntax:
```python
SeriesName.between(left, right, inclusive='both')
```
- `left` : Lower boundary of the range
- `right` : Upper boundary of the range
- `inclusive` : Indicate whether to include the boundary values. 
	Values,
	1. both 
	2. neither
	3. left
	4. right

> [!NOTE] Default values of "inclusive" parameter
> The `between()` method in pandas is inclusive of both the left and right boundaries by default(`both`). 
> This means that the method will include the boundary values in the filtered results unless specified otherwise.

Ex: Filtering a Series
```python
import pandas as pd
s = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
```

1. Filter this series for values between 20 and 40.

2. Filter this Series for for values between 20 and 50, excluding both ends.

Ex: Filtering a DataFrame
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],
    'B': [5, 15, 25, 35, 45]
})
```

1. Filter this DataFrame for values between 20 and 40 in the column 'A'.

2. Filter this DataFrame for values between 20 and 40, inclusive of left boundary in the column 'A'.

##### Practical Example
This method is useful for filtering date ranges.
```python
date_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Date': pd.date_range('2024-01-01', periods=5, freq='D'),
    'Value': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
})

# Using between() to filter dates
start_date = '2024-01-02'
end_date = '2024-01-04'
filtered_date_df = date_df[date_df['Date'].between(start_date, end_date)]
print(filtered_date_df)
```
