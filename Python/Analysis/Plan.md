## ==Analysis Plan==
1. Descriptive analysis
- **Average rating** 
	Calculate the average rating for the wines to identify the overall sentiment of the wines in the dataset.
- **Price distribution**
	Plot the distribution of prices to see the range and frequency of wine prices in the dataset.
- **Alcohol content range**
	Calculate the average and range of alcohol content for different wines.
- **Wine Style Popularity**
	Determine the most popular wine styles based on frequency or average rating.

2. Correlation analysis
- **Price vs. Rating** 
	Check if there’s any correlation between wine price and rating. 
	Do higher-priced wines generally get higher ratings?
- **Alcohol Content vs. Rating** 
	Investigate if wines with higher alcohol content tend to have higher or lower ratings.
- **Bold, Tannin, Sweet, and Acidic vs. Rating**
	Analyse how the various flavour descriptors (Bold, Tannin, Sweet, Acidic) correlate with wine ratings.

3. Regional analysis
- **Wine Styles by Region**
	Group wines by their region and check the most common wine styles in each region.
- **Average Rating by Region** 
	Calculate the average ratings for wines by region to see if certain regions have better-rated wines.

4. Food pairing analysis
- **Most Common Food Pairings**
	Identify the most common food pairings for different wines. This can help identify trends in flavour profiles and regional food preferences.
- **Food Pairings vs. Wine Rating**
	Analyse if wines with specific food pairings tend to have higher or lower ratings.

5. Wine characteristic clustering
- **Clustering by Characteristics** 
	Use clustering techniques like K-means to group wines with similar characteristics (e.g., Bold, Tannin, Sweet, Acidic) to identify patterns or wine types.
- **Wine Style Distribution Across Clusters**
	See which wine styles are prevalent in different clusters.

6. Wine price segmentation
- **Price Categories**
	Segment wines into different price ranges (e.g., low, medium, high) and analyse average ratings, alcohol content, and other factors across these price categories.
- **Price vs. Number of Ratings**
	Examine if wines with more ratings tend to have a higher or lower price point.

7. Consumer behaviour analysis
- **Most Rated Wines**
	Identify the wines with the highest number of ratings. These could indicate popular or highly marketed wines.
- **Wine Popularity Over Time**
	If you have time data, analyse how the popularity of certain wines changes over time.

8. Trend analysis
- **Wine Style Trend Over Time**
	If data spans multiple years, track the popularity of different wine styles over time.
- **Price Trends by Year** 
	Analyse if wine prices have been increasing or decreasing over the years.

9. Wine pairing recommendations
- **Suggest Wines Based on Ratings**
	Based on the ratings, suggest wines that have high ratings for specific food pairings (e.g., beef, lamb).

## ==Expecting Conclusions==
1. Wine rating and price correlation
There may or may not be a strong correlation between price and rating. For instance, you might find that more expensive wines do not always receive higher ratings, suggesting that consumer preferences are not solely based on price. Alternatively, you might observe a positive correlation, indicating that higher-priced wines are generally better rated by consumers.

2. Popular wine styles by region
Certain wine styles may dominate in specific regions. For example, you might conclude that Australian wines, particularly from South Australia, tend to favour bold red wines like Shiraz, while other regions might focus more on whites or blends. This conclusion could help identify regional wine trends and preferences.

3. Food pairing preferences
Based on food pairing data, you might find that wines with certain characteristics (e.g., bold reds) are more commonly paired with hearty dishes like beef, lamb, and game meats. This can provide valuable information for recommending wines based on meal choices. Additionally, wines with less tannin might be paired more frequently with lighter dishes like poultry.

4. Alcohol content and rating trends
You might conclude that wines with moderate alcohol content (e.g., 13–14%) tend to receive higher ratings, indicating that consumers prefer wines that are not overly alcoholic but balanced. Alternatively, you may find that certain high-alcohol wines (e.g., 14.5% or higher) consistently perform well, especially in full-bodied styles like Shiraz.

5. Clustering and wine characteristics
The clustering analysis could reveal that wines with similar flavor profiles (e.g., bold tannins, high acidity) tend to group together. This could indicate that certain characteristics are more desirable in certain wine styles or regions, helping wineries better target their audience based on the wine’s attributes.

6. Price segmentation insight
If you segment wines into different price ranges, you might find that the majority of wines fall into a mid-range price category (e.g., $15–$30). This could suggest that consumers are most willing to purchase wines in this range, which could be valuable for wineries and marketers when setting pricing strategies.

7. consumer behaviour insight
Wines with a high number of ratings may reflect popular choices, while wines with fewer ratings could indicate niche or premium products. If a wine has a high rating but fewer reviews, you might conclude that it’s a hidden gem or a more specialized product that appeals to a particular audience.

8. Consumer Preferences Based on Sweetness and Acidity
If the dataset includes sweetness and acidity metrics, you might conclude that wines with a balanced sweetness and acidity tend to get the best ratings, or that overly sweet wines or highly acidic wines are less favoured. This could inform winemakers about which flavour profiles are more appealing to consumers.

9. Regional and Price-Based Recommendations
You could conclude that wines from certain regions (e.g., South Australia) consistently receive high ratings at a particular price point, making them ideal candidates for recommendations in specific price ranges. For example, a wine with a price point under $20 from a popular region might be recommended to budget-conscious consumers looking for quality wines.

10. Marketing and Sales Strategy
Based on the analysis, wineries can identify which wines are most likely to perform well in the market. For example, wines with certain characteristics (like a specific alcohol content, boldness, or tannin level) might appeal to a particular demographic, while wines with food-pairing suggestions could be marketed as ideal options for specific meals or occasions.
