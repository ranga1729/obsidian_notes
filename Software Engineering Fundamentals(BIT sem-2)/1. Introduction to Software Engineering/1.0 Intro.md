#### What is a Software ?
Software is any set of machine-readable instructions to the computer's processor to perform specific operations. 
- Software system is a collection of intercommunicating components, programs, configuration files, system documentations and user documentations.
- Software products may be,
	1. **Generic** - developed to be sold to range of different customers.
	2. **Bespoke(custom)** - developed for a single customer according to their specifications.

#### Differences in Software Engineering compared to Other Engineering disciplines. 
- Difficult for a customer to specify requirements completely. 
- Difficult for a developer to understand customer needs completely. 
- Customers and developers have communication gaps.
- Requirements change regularly.
- The environment which software if made for, change regularly. 
- Software is primarily intangible(not-perceptible).
	(intangible = unable to touch, not having a physical presence.)
	Process of creating software is also intangible. 
	It involves experience, thoughts and imaginations. 
	A brain product.
- Difficult to test software exhaustively. 
- Software can be developed in diverse context ranging from embedded systems to giant manufacturing systems. 
- Software becomes more complex as changes made over time. 
- A small change to a few lines of code could do a big change in the overall behavior of the system. 

#### Types of software
Two main types,
1. System Software: Designed to operate and control the computer hardware and to provide a platform for running application software. 
2. Application Software: Designed to perform specific applications.

#### Application Software Types

Another categorization of application software,
1. **Stand-alone applications**
	Run on local computers(PCs)
	Includes all necessary functionalities & do not required to be connected to a network. 
2. **Interactive transaction-based applications**
	Executes on a remote computer and are accessed by users from their own PCs or terminals. 
	Ex: Web applications such as e-commerce applications
3. **Embedded control systems**
	Control and manage hardware devices.
4. **Batch processing systems**
	Business systems that are designed to process data in large batches. 
	Process large number of individual inputs to create corresponding outputs.
5. **Entertainment Systems**
	Intended to entertain the user.
6. **Systems for modeling and simulation**
	Developed by scientists and engineers to model physical process or situations, which include many separate interacting models. 
7. **Data collection systems**
	Collect data from their environment using set of sensors and send that data to other systems for processing.
8. **Systems of Systems**
	Systems that are composed of a number of other software systems.

#### Software Costs
- Software costs often dominate computer systems costs. 
- The costs of software on a PC are often greater than the hardware costs.
- Software costs more to maintain than it develop. 
- For systems with a long life, maintain cots may be several times development costs. 
- Software engineering is concerned with cost-effective software development.

- The software development cost increased rapidly over the time while the hardware becomes cheaper and cheaper with the development of the technology.

### Failure Curves for Software & Hardware
#### 1. Failure Curve for Hardware
Software is engineered or developed, not manufactured and Software doesn't wear out(outdate) in the same sense as hardware. 
- So, the failing rate of hardware is high at the initial stage.
- The failure rate decreases with the time and the hardware become more stable since the quality of the hardware is improved. 
- Failure rate again goes up in a particular hardware when it come to the wear out stage.

#### 2. Failure Curve of Software
Software projects can be failed due to two main reasons,
1. Increasing system complexity
2. Failure to use software engineering methods

Failure rate of a software is also high like hardware because there can be un-detected bugs/errors. But software do not wear out with the time.
Failure rate of software can go high, when a new change introduced to the software. Software become unstable when adding new features continuously.

(Idealized curve is what we expect.)
