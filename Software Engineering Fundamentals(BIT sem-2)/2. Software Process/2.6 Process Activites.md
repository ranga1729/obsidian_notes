Process activities are,
1. Software specification
2. Software development
3. Software validation
4. Software evolution
### 1. Software Specification
- A.K.A. **"Requirement Engineering."**
- Establish what services are required and constraints on the system's operation and development.
- Before the requirements engineering process start, a company may carry a **feasibility study** or market study to assess whether there is a market for the software and whether it is technically and financially realistic to develop the software required. 

Steps of Requirement Engineering process,
1. **Requirement elicitation and analysis**
	Get information about What do the system stakeholders expect from the system. 
2. **Requirement specification**
	Define a set of requirements in a document using the information gathered during the requirement analysis. 
	Mainly requirements are two categories,
		1. User requirements
		2. System requirements
3. **Requirement validation**
	Checking the validity of the requirement.

### 2. Software Development(Software design and implementation)
- This is the process of converting system specification into an executable system.
**Software Design**: Design the software structure that applies the specification.
**Software Implementation**: Translate this structure into a executable program.
- Activities of design and implementation are closely related and may be interleaved.
#### A general model of design process

1. **Architectural Design**: Identify the 
	overall structure of the system, 
	Key components(sub-systems/modules)
	and their relationship.
2. **Interface Design**: Define the user interfaces
3. **Database Design**: Define system data structure and how these are to be represented in a database. Either use an existing database or a new database will be created. 
4. **Component selection and design**: Search for reusable components and if there's no suitable components available, new design has to be created. 
### 3. Software Validation
- Verification and Validation(V & V) intended to show that a system conform to its specifications and meets the requirements of the customer. 
**Verification**: checking that the software meets the specification.
	Walkthrough
	Inspections
	Review
**Validation**: checking whether the specifications meets the customer requirements. 
	Testing
#### Stages of Testing
![[Pasted image 20240405141729.png]]
1. **Component Testing**
	Individual components(functions or objects) are tested independently. 
2. **System testing**
	Testing the system as a whole. Testing of emergent properties is also important.
3. **Acceptance testing**
	Testing the system with customer data to check it meets the customer needs.

- When a plan-driven approach is used to develop the software(Ex: for critical system developments), testing is driven by a set of "test plans." An independent software testers work using these test plans. Test plans are developed using system specifications and design.
### 4. Software Evolution(Maintenance)
- It is very expensive to make changes to hardware designs. But unlike hardware, changes can be made to software at any time during or after the system development. 
- even extensive changes are still much cheaper than corresponding changes to system hardware.
