Software process models can be divide into two main categories,
1. **Plan-driven processes** - all of the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measures against this plan.
2. **Agile processes** -  Planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing requirements. 
- In practice, most practical processes include elements of both plan-driven and agile approaches. 
- There are no right or wrong software process.

##### Software Process models,
1. **The waterfall model**
	Plan-driven model.
	Separate and distinct phases of specification and development.
2. **Incremental Development**
	Specification, development and validation are interleaved.
	May be plan-driven or agile.
3. **Reuse-oriented software engineering(Integration and configuration)**
	The system is assembled from existing components. 
	May be plan-driven or agile.
