Process improvements means understanding existing process and changing these process to increase product quality, reduce costs and reduce development time.

Process improvement approaches,
1. **The process maturity approach**
	Focuses in improving process and project management and introducing software engineering best practices. 
	The level of process maturity reflects the extent of good technical and management practices has been adopted in organizational software development process. 
2. The Agile approach
	Focuses on iterative development and the reduction of overheads in the software process. 
	The primary characteristics of agile methods are rapid delivery of functionality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.
#### Process Improvement cycle

1. **Process Measurements**
	Measure one or more attributes of the software process of software product(Like KPIs). These measurements forms a baseline that helps you decide if process improvements have been effective.
2. **Process Analysis**
	Asses current process and identify process weaknesses and bottlenecks. Develop a "Process model"(Process maps) that describe how the process is going on. 
3. **Process Change**
	Propose process changes to fix identified process weaknesses. These changes are introduced and this process improvement cycle must resume to collect data about the effectiveness of the changes.

- Quantitative Process data should be collected wherever possible. 
	Where organizations do not have clearly defined process standards this is very difficult as you don't know what yo measure. A process may have to be defined before any measurement is possible. 
- Process measurements should be used to asses process improvements.
	But this does not mean that measurements should drive the improvements. The improvement drive should be the organization objectives.

#### Process Metrics
1. Time taken to process activities to be completed
	Ex: Calendar time or effort to complete an activity or process.
2. Resources required for processes or activities.
	Ex: Total effort in person-day.
3. Number of occurrences of a particular event. 
	Ex: Number of defects discovered.

### Capability Maturity Levels

#### The SEI Capability Maturity Model
The SEI Capability Maturity Model (CMM), developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University, is a framework for assessing and improving the maturity of an organization's software development processes. It describes five levels of process maturity, with each level representing an increasingly more controlled and optimized approach to software development.
- **Initial**
	Essentially uncontrolled.
	process are chaotic and uncontrolled. 
- **Repeatable**
	Product management procedure defined and used. 
	(Basic project management practices are in place.)
- **Defined**
	Process management procedures and strategies defined and used.
	(Processes are documented, standardized, and consistently followed.)
- **Managed**
	Process management procedures and strategies defined and used. 
	(Software development processes are controlled and measured.)
- **Optimizing**
	Process improvement strategies defined and used. 
	(Focus on continuous process improvement through innovation.)
