1. **Requirement Specification**
	Initial requirements for the system are proposed. 
	These do not have to be elaborated in detail but should include brief descriptions of essential requirements and desirable system features. 
2. **Software discovery and Evolution**
	A search is made for components and systems that provide the functionality required.
	Candidate components and systems are evaluated to see if they meet the essential requirements and if they are generally suitable for use in the system.
3. **Requirement refinement**
	The requirements are refined using information about the reusable components and applications that have been discovered.
	The requirements are modified to reflect to the available components. And the system specification is re-defined. Where modifications are impossible, the component analysis activity may be re-entered to search for alternative solutions. 
4. **Application system configuration**
	If an off-the-shelf application system that meet the requirements is available, it may be configured for use to create the new system.
5. **Component adaptation and Integration**
	If there is no off-the-shelf system, individual reusable components may be modified and new components developed. 
	These are then integrated to create the system.
