- Situations where software changes require,
	1. Business changes
	2. New technologies
	3. Changing platforms
- Changes leads to rework(Ex: re-analyzing requirements). So,
	Cost of change = cost of rework + cost of implementing new functionalities.
- Approaches to reduce the cost of rework,
	1. **Change anticipation**
		Predict possible changes before significant rework is required.
		Ex: Develop a prototype system to show customers and identify possible improvements that can be done to the final output. 
	2. **Change tolerance**
		Design software in a way that changes can be easily made to the system. 
		Usually happens in incremental development because proposed changes may be implemented in increments that have not yet developed. 

### Software Prototyping
A prototype is an initial version of a system used to demonstrate concepts and try out design options. 
A prototype can be used in,
	1. The requirement engineering process
		To help with requirements elicitation and validation
	2. System design process
		To explore software solutions and develop a UI design.

- Benefits of prototyping,
	1. Improved system usability.
	2. A closer match to user's real needs.
	3. Improved design quality.
	4. Improved maintainability.
	5. Reduced development effort.

### Incremental Delivery
Incremental delivery is an approach to software development where some of the developed increments are delivered to the customer and deployed for use in their working environment. 

In this process, the customer decide which of the services are most important and which are least important to them. 
Once the system increment have been identified, the requirements for the services to be delivered in the first increment are defined in details and that increment is developed. 

During the development, further requirement analysis for later increments can take place, but requirement changes for the current increment are not accepted. 
Once an increment is completed and delivered, it is installed in the customer's normal working environment so the customer can experiment with the system. This help them to give feedback on the new increment and clarify new requirements for later increments. 
As new increments are completed, they are integrated with existing increments to improve system functionality. 

Early increments act as a prototype to help elicit requirements for later increments. This lower the risk of overall project failure. The highest priority system services tent to receive the most testing. 
#### Problems of Incremental Delivery
1. This approach is not suitable when the new system is intended to replace and existing system.
	User need all of the functionality of the old system and are usually unwilling to experiment with an incomplete new system.
	It is not practical to use the old system and the new system alongside each other as they are likely to have different databases and user interfaces.
2. Most systems require  set of basic facilities that re used by different parts of the system.
	As requirements are not defined in details until an increment is to be implemented, it can be hard to identify common facilities that are needed by all increments.
