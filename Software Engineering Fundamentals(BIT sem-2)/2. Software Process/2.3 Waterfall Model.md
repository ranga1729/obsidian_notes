The first published model of the software development process. 
This is a plan-driven process. 
In principle, you plan and schedule all of the process activities before starting software development.

1. **Requirement analysis and definition**
	System services, constraints and goals are defined in details by consulting system users. 
2. **System and software design**
	Identify and describe the fundamental software system abstractions and their relationships.
	Allocate required hardware and software components.
	Establishes an overall system architecture. 
3. **Implementation and unit testing**
	In this stage, the software design is realized as a set of programs or program units. Unit testing involves verifying that each unit meet its specification.
4. **Integration and system testing**
	The individual program units integrated all together and tested as a complete system to ensure that the software requirements have been met. 
	Completed software system is delivered to the customer.
5. **Operation and Maintenance**
	The system is installed and put into practical use. 
	Maintenance involves,
		Correcting errors that were not discovered in earlier stages. 
		Improving the implementation of system units.
		Enhancing the system's services as new requirements are discovered.

Waterfall model is ideal to use when,
1. Requirements are not changing frequently.
2. Requirement is clear.
3. Application is not complicated and big.
4. Project is short.
5. Environment is stable. 
6. Technology and tools used are not dynamic and is stable. 
7. Resources are available and trained.

| Previous phase must be completed before the next phase begins.                         | Errors can be fixed only during the phase.                               |
| Suited for smaller projects where requirements are well defined.                       | Not suitable for complex projects where requirements changes frequently. |
| QA test(verification and validation) should be performed before completing each stage. | Testing period come quite late in the development process.               |
| Documentation is done at every phase of the software development cycle.                | Documentation occupied a lot of time of developers and testers.          |
| Minimum client intervention required.                                                  | Client feedbacks are not included with ongoing development phase.        |
