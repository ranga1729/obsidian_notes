Incremental development is based on the idea of 
	developing an initial implementation, 
	getting feedback from users and
	evolving the software through several versions until the  required system has been developed. 
System development is broken down into many mini development projects. Highest priority requirement is tackled first. Partial systems are successively built to produce a final total system.

#### Benefits
1. Software development process is fast.
2. Flexible and less expensive to change requirements and scope.
3. Changes can be done even during the development process. 
4. Less costly compared to other models.
5. Customer can give feedback on each increment.
6. Errors are easy to be identified.

#### Problems
1. The process is not visible.
	Managers need regular deliverables to measure progress.
	If systems are developed quickly, it is not cost-effective to produce documents that reflect every version of the system.
2. System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added.
	Unless time and money is spent on refactoring to improve the software, regular change tends to corrupt its structure. 
	Incorporating further software changes becomes increasingly difficult and costly.
