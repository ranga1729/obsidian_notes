The principle responsibility of software managers is to manage the project so that the software is delivered on time and within the planned budget for the project.
The standard approach to project management is plan-driven. Managers draw up a plan for the project showing what should be delivered, when it should be delivered and who will work on the development of the project deliverables.
Agile project management requires a different approach, which is adapted to incremental development and the practices used in agile methods.
