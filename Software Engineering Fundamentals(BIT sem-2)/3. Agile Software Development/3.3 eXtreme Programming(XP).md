XP is an Agile Software Development Process created by Kent Beck in the mid 1990's. It's a set of **12 key practices** and it takes *an extreme approach* to iterative development. 
Ex: 
- New version may be built several time per day.
- Increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks.
- All tests must be run for every build and the build is only accepted if tests run successfully. 
- Deliver most needed, when it's needed.
#### 12 Practices
1. The planning game
2. Small releases
3. Metaphor
4. Simple design
5. Testing(Test Driven Development-TDD)
6. Refactoring
7. Pair programming
8. Collective code ownership
9. Continuous integration
10. 40-Hour workweek
11. on-site customer
12. Coding standards

#### 1. The planning game
This is a collaborative meeting between the development team and stakeholder, customers to plan the upcoming iteration and releases. 
Focusing on two major thing,
1. Release planning
	Customer prioritize features represented as **User Stories.**
	Team estimates the effort required for each story.
	This collaboration helps determine what functionalities will be included in upcoming releases and when those releases can be delivered. 
2. Iteration planning(1-2 weeks)
	The team selects **User stories** from the prioritized **release backlog** considering their capacity and workload. Then team members assign those tasks among themselves. 
##### User Stories
A user story is a brief, informal description of a software features (user requirements) written from the perspective of the end user. It captures what the user want to achieve and why it's important to them. 
- User stories describes a feature that delivers values to the user.
- It's written from the users' point of view using plain language.
- They are short and to the point. 
- A user story should be small enough to be estimates in terms of development effort. This helps with planning and scheduling in agile development methodologies. 

> [!NOTE] Syntax of a User Story,
> As a [role]
> I want [feature]
> So that [benefit]

Ex:
	As a **Student**
	I want **to purchase a parking pass**
	So that **I can drive to school**

#### 2. Small Releases
Releases are small in terms of functionality. Less functionality means releases happen more frequently. Frequent releases with new features allow for early feedback and course correction.
And also, small releases help planning game. 
The minimal useful set of functionality that provides business value is developed first. 
#### 3. Metaphor
A metaphor refers to a simple and relatable analogy or story used to conceptualize and describe the software system being developed. The goal is to create a common understanding among the entire team, including developers, customers and potential even end users. 
#### 4. Simple Design
Enough design us carried out to meet the current requirements and no more. Deliver exactly what is needed to be delivered, nothing more or nothing less. 
#### 5. Testing
The program is tested after every change has been made. 
Testing methods,
1. Test-Driven Development(TDD)
	This is a core practice where unit tests are written before the actual code. The test define the expected behavior of the code and the developers writes code that fulfills those expectations. 
	TDD promotes early bug detection.
2. Continuous Integration
	These increments also need to be test. 
3. Acceptance Testing
	Customer or business stakeholders validate the functionality of the entire system against requirements. This ensures the developed features align with user needs. 
- Automated testing frameworks are used to do testing.
	All previous and new test are run automatically when new functionality is added
	Ex: JUnit
#### 6. Refactoring
==Refactoring is the practice of continuously improving the structure of the code without altering its overall functionality.== 
It's a crucial practice for maintain a clean, maintainable and adaptable codebase throughout the development lifecycle. 
All developers are expected to refactor the code continuously as soon as possible. 

Benefits,
- Code becomes easy to understand.
- Code becomes easy to modify.
- Reduce maintenance cost and effort. 
- Helps break down complex code into smaller, more manageable pieces. 
- Code becomes more adaptable to changing requirements. 
- New features can be integrated more easily. 
#### 7. Pair Programming
![[Pasted image 20240510015210.png]]
==Two programmers work together at once workstation to collaboratively design, code, test and debug software.== 
It promotes knowledge sharing, improved code quality and better communication within the development team.

Roles,
1. **Driver** : Actively writing code, implementing the design and logic. They are in control of the keyboard and mouse. 
2. **Navigator** : Observes the drivers work, reviewing each line of code as it is written. Think strategically about the overall approach, identify potential improvement and suggest alternative solutions. 
- Developers can change roles as they need. 
Benefits,
- Improved code quality
- knowledge sharing
- Enhanced communication
#### 8. Collective Code Ownership
==Collective code ownership is a fundamental principle where the entire development team is responsible for the quality, design and implementation of the entire codebase.== 
There is no single owner for specific module or sections. 

Key aspects,
- Shared responsibility.
- Increased code quality. 
- Improved knowledge sharing.
- Reduced risk.
#### 9. Continuous Integration
Continuous integration aimed at achieving frequent and seamless integration of code changes from all developers. It emphasizes merging code into a shared mainline repository multiple times a day, ideally after every completed feature or task.

As soon as the work on a task is completed, it is integrated into the whole system.
After any such integration, all the unit test in the system must pass. 

Benefits,
- Early detection of Issues.
- Improved code quality.
	Constant feedback loop from automated builds and test encourages developers to write clean and maintainable code. 
- Reduced risk of integration hell.
- Increased team collaboration.

Challenges,
- Implementing an automated build and test system can require some initial effort and configuration.
- As the codebase grows, it's crucial to maintain and update the automated test to ensure they remain effective. 
- Automated builds and tests can take some time to run.
#### 10. 40-Hour Week/Sustainable pace
The work week should be limited to 40 hours.
The core concept is to maintain a sustainable workload for the development team. This means working at a pace that can be consistently maintained over a long period, ideally for the entire project duration. It avoids burnouts and ensures the team can deliver working software iteratively. 
#### 11. On-Site Customers
A representative of the end-user of the system should be available full time for the use of the XP team.
In XP process, the customer is a member of the development team and is responsible for bringing system requirements to the team for implementation. 
#### 12. Coding Standards
All code should look the same.
XP emphasizes the importance of establishing a set of consistent coding practices that the entire team agrees on. 
Considerations,
- Naming conventions
	Ex: camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes, snake_case for filenames.
- Formatting
	Ex: Indentations, spacing, line breaks
- Commenting
- Code structure
	Ex: File organization, class structure, modularity principles
- Version control practices

### XP and Agile Principles
- Incremental development is supported through small, frequent system releases.
- Customer involvement means full-time customer engagement with the team.
- Maintaining simplicity through constant refactoring of code.
- Requirement changes are made through regular system releases. 

### Advantages of XP
- Built-in quality control
- Overall simplicity
- Programmer power
- Customer power
- Synergy between practices
### Disadvantages of XP
- Informal, little or no documentation.
- Contract issues.
