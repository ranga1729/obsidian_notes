Agile development methods emerged in the late 1990 to radically reduce the delivery time for working software systems. 
These methods are,
1. Focus on the code rather than the design.
2. Based on an iterative approach
3. Intended to deliver & evolve working software quickly and meet the changing requirements. 
==The aim of agile methods is to reduce overheads in the software process and to be able to respond quickly to changing requirements without excessive rework.== 

### Agile Manifesto
![[Pasted image 20240508124844.png]]

> [!NOTE] Agile Manifesto
> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to values,
> - Individual and interactions over process and tools.
> - Working software over comprehensive documentation.
> - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
> - Responding to change over following a plan.
> 
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

#### Agile Principles
1. Highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
3. Delivery working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. 
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure.
8. Agile process promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential. 
11. The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjust its behavior accordingly. 
### What is Agile Software Development ?
Agile is an umbrella term for a set of methods and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Agile manifesto.

- Program specification, design and implementation are inter-leaved.
- The system is developed as a series of versions or increments with stakeholders involved in version specification and evaluation.
- Frequent delivery of new versions for evaluation. 
- Extensive tools used to support development. (Ex: automated testing tools)
- Minimal documentation, focus on working code.
### Plan-Driven vs Agile Development

#### Is Agile better ?

Feedback points,
- Corrections
- Modifications
- Re-prioritizing
- Usability analysis
Agility of this methods leads to,
1. Decrease risk
2. More feedbacks
3. Less confusions
4. More satisfaction

Agile method can be used to,
- Small or medium sized product development.
- Custom system development within organization.
- Experiments in using agile approaches for critical systems engineering.
	Security, safety and dependability analysis need significant modifications before applying. 
#### Drawback/Difficulties of Agile
- Custom representatives are subject to other pressures and cannot take full part in the software development.
- Individual team members may not have suitable personalities for the intense involvement/team work.
- Prioritizing changes can be extremely difficult when there are lot of stakeholders. 
- Under pressure from delivery schedules, the team may not have time to carry system simplifications.
- Cultural changes - team members may find it hard to change the practice (informal/defined by team itself)
