Agile methods have proved to be successful for small and medium sized projects that can be developed by a small co-located teams.
It is sometimes argued that the success of these methods comes because of improved communications which is possible when everyone is working together. 
Scaling up agile methods involves changing these to cope with larger, longer projects where there are multiple development teams, perhaps working in different locations.

**'Scaling up'** is concerned with using methods for developing large software systems that can not be developed by a small team.
**'Scaling out'** us concerned with how agile methods can be introduced across a large organization with many years of software development experience.

When scaling agile methods it is important to maintain agile fundamentals like flexible planning, frequent system releases, continuous integration, test-driven development and good team communications.

### Practical Problems with Agile Methods
- The informality of agile development is incompatible with the legal approach to contract definitions.
- Agile methods are mostly appropriate for new software development rather than software maintenance.
- Agile methods are designed for small co-located teams but most of companies involves employees worldwide. 
#### Contractual Issues
Most software contracts for custom system are based around a specification, which sets out what has to be implemented by the system developer. 
A contract that pays for developers time rather than functionality is required because what has to be delivered can not be guaranteed at the first hand.
#### Agile Methods and Software Maintenance
Key problems,
1. Lack of product documentation.
2. Keeping customers involved in the development process.
3. Maintaining the continuity of the development team
Agile development relies on the development team knowing and understanding what has to be done.
For long-lifetime systems, this is a real problem as the original developers will not always work on the system.
#### Agile and Plan-driven methods
Most projects include elements of plan-driven and agile processes. Deciding on the balance depends on,
- If very detailed specification and design is important to have before moving to implementation, plan-driven approach is better.
- If incremental delivery strategy and getting rapid feedback is realistic, agile methods is better. 
- If a small co-located team can develop the system, Agile is better. For larger projects which require larger development teams, plan-driven approach is better.

Factors affects the System, Team and Organization in Agile and Plan-based methods.

**System issues,**
1. How large is the system being developed.
	Agile methods are most effective on relatively small co-located team who can communicate informally. 
2. What type of system is being developed ?
3. What is the expected system lifetime ?
4. Is the system subject to external regulation ?
**People and Team issues,**
1. How good are the designers and programmers in the development team ?
2. How is the development team organized ?
3. What support technologies are available ?
**Organizational Issues,**
1. Traditional engineering organization have a culture of plan-based development.
2. Is it standard organizational practice to developed a details system specification ?
3. Will customer representatives be available to provide feedback of system increments ?
4. Can informal agile development fit into the organizational culture of detailed documentation ?

### Agile methods for Large Systems
Large systems systems are usually collections of separate, communicating systems where separate teams develop each system.
Large systems and their development processes are often constrained by external rules and regulations limiting the way that they can be developed.
Large systems have a long procurement and development time. It is difficult to maintain coherent teams who know about the system over that period as, inevitably people move on to other jobs and projects.
Large systems usually have a diverse set of stakeholders. It is practically impossible to involve all of these different stakeholders in the development process.

### Scaling up to large systems
A completely incremental approach to requirement engineering is impossible. 
there cannot be a single product owner or customer representative.
For large systems development, it is not possible to focus only on the code of the system.
Cross team communication mechanism have to designed and used.
Continuous integration is practically impossible. However it is essential to maintain frequent system builds and regular releases of the system.
### Multi-team Scrum
1. **Role replication**
	Each team has a product owner for their work component and scrum master.
2. **Product architect**
	Each team chooses a product architect and these architects collaborate to design and evolve the overall system architecture.
3. **Release alignment**
	The dates of product releases from each team are aligned so that a demonstratable and complete system is product.
4. **Scrum of Scrums**
	There is a daily scrum of scrums where representatives from each team meet to discuss progress and plan work to be done. 
#### Agile methods across organizations
- Project managers who do not have experience of agile methods may be reluctant to accept the risk of new approach.
- Large organizations often have quality procedures and standards that all projects are expected to follow and because of their bureaucratic nature, these are likely to be incompatible with agile methods.
- Agile methods seem to work best when team members have a relatively high skill level. However, within large organizations there are likely to be a wide range of skills and abilities.
- There are may be cultural resistance to agile methods, especially in those organizations that have a long history of using conventional systems engineering processes.
