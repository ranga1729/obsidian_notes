Software development projects being cancelled every now and then. One in every two projects exceed its budget by 200%. 
Reasons,
1. Do not meet the need of the user. 
2. Deadline rush.
3. Less number of features delivered.
4. Poor interface.

Success is not just functions anymore. Lot more expectations from users including,
	speed delivery
	accuracy
	Features vs usability.

### Waterfall Model
![[Pasted image 20240405211545.png]]
Assumptions used in this model,
1. Requirements can be entirely predicted upfront.
2. Each phase of the lifecycle can be perfected before moving to the next. 
3. Timeframes and budgets can be predicted up front. 
4. The feedback from the real user is not so valuable.

Causes for failures,
1. Poor communication.
2. Feedback us obtained at the end of the project.

### Rapid Software Development
Rapid development and delivery is now often the most important requirement for software systems. since the businesses operate in a fast-changing world, software has to evolve quickly to reflect changing business needs and also software has to be stable. 
- Plan driven development is good for fast delivery but software may be stable as much as we want.
