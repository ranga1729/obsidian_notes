Scrum is a agile method that focuses on managing iterative development rather than specific agile practices. 

Three phases in Scrum,
1. Outline planning phase: 
	Establish the general objectives for the project and design the software architecture. 
- 2nd phase is followed by a series of sprint cycles, where each cycle develops and increment of the system.
- Project closure phase: 
	Wraps up the project. 
	Completes required documentation such as system help frames and user manuals and assesses the lessons learned from the project.

### What is Scrum ?
Scrum is an Agile framework for completing complex projects to achieve highest business value within the shortest time. 
And also scrum is,
- Lightweight
- Simple to understand
- Difficult to master

Scrum roles,
1. Product Owner
	Owns the vision and goals of the project.
	Represent all stakeholders.
	Responsible for requirements and maximizing ROI.
2. Scrum Master
	Responsible for the scrum process.
	Protects the team and help remove impediments.(blocks)
	Servant leader.
	3Ps: Problem solver, Process Coach, Protector
3. Team
	Responsible for doing the work.
	No more than 7 members.
	Self-managed and self-organizing.
	Cross functional.
### Scrum Three Pillars

### SCRUM Terminology
- **Development team** : A self-organizing group of software developers, which should be no more than 7 people. They are responsible for developing the software and other essential project documents. 
- **Potential shippable product increment** : The software increment that is delivered form a sprit. 'Shippable' means the increment is finished, no further work such as testing and needed to increment it into the final product. 
- **Product backlog** : This is a list of 'to do' items which the scrum team must tackle. They may be feature definitions for the software, software requirements, user stories or descriptions of supplementary tasks that are needed.
- **Product owner** : An individual whose job is to identify product features or requirements, prioritizing these for development and continuously review the product backlog to ensure that the project continues to meet critical business needs. The product owner can be a customer but might also be a product manager in a software company or other stakeholder representative. 
- **Scrum** : A daily meeting of the scrum team that reviews progress and priorities work to be done that day. Ideally, this should be a short face-to-face meeting that includes the whole team.
- **Sprint** : A development iteration. Sprint are usually 1-4 weeks long. 
- **Velocity** : An estimate of how much product backlog effort that a team can cover in a single sprint. Understanding a team's velocity helps them estimate what can be covered in a sprint and provides a basis for measuring improving performance. 
### SCRUM Sprint Cycle
![[Pasted image 20240512010520.png]]
- Sprints are fixed length, normally 1-4 weeks.
- The starting point for planning is the product backlog, which is the list of work to be done on the project.
- The selection phase involves all of the project team who work with the customer to select the features and functionality from the product backlog to be developed during the sprint. 
- Once these are agreed, the team organize themselves to develop the software.
- During this stage the team is isolated from the customer and the organization, with all communication channeled through the Scrum master.
- At the end of the sprint, the work done is reviewed and presented to stakeholders. The next sprint cycle then begins. 
### Teamwork in SCRUM
- The scrum master is a facilitator who
	arranges daily meetings,
	track the backlog work to be done,
	record decisions
	measure progress against the backlog and 
	communicates with customers and management outside of the team.
- The whole team attends short daily meeting(scrums) where all team members share information including,
	progress since the last meeting
	problems that have arisen
	what is planned for the following day
This means that everyone knows what is going on and if problems arise, can re-plan short-term work to cope with them.

### Benefits of SCRUM
- The product is broken down into a set of manageable and understandable chunks.
- Unstable requirements do not hold up progress.
- The whole team have visibility of everything.
- Customer see on-time delivery of increments and gain feedbacks on how the product works.
- Trust between customers and developers is established and a positive culture is created in which everyone expects the project to succeed.
