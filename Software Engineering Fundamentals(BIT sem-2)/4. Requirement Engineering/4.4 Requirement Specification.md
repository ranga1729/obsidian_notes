Requirement specification is the process of writing down the user and system requirements in a requirements document.
The user and system requirements should be,
	clear
	unambiguous
	easy to understand
	complete and 
	consistent

- **User Requirements** are almost always written in natural language supplemented by appropriate diagrams and tables in the requirement document. 
- **System Requirements** may also written in natural language but other notations, graphical or mathematical system models can be used.

Notations used for writing system requirements,
1. Natural language 
	Numbered sentences in natural language
	One sentence = one requirement
2. Structured natural language
	Written in natural language on a standard form or template
	Each field provide information about an aspect of the requirement.
3. Graphical notation
	Graphical models, supplemented by text annotations.
	UML use case diagrams and sequence diagrams are commonly used.
4. Mathematical specifications
	Based on mathematical concepts such as finite-state machine or sets. 
	These notations reduces the ambiguity in requirement documents.

#### Graphical Notations : Use Cases
In the **Unified Modeling Language(UML)**, a use case diagram is used to summarize the details of your system's users(also known as actors) and their interactions with the system.

**An effective use case diagram represent,**
- Scenarios in which your system or application interacts with people, organizations or external systems.
- Goals that your system or application helps hose entities/actors achieve
- The scope of your system

**Use cases deal only functional requirements for a system.**

**Importance of use case diagrams,**
- To identify functions and how roles interact with them.
- For a high-level view of the system.
	Useful when presenting to stakeholders. 
- To identify internal and external factors

**Objects of use case diagrams,**
1. Actors
2. Use case
3. System
4. Relationships
****
##### 1. Actors
- Actors in a use case diagram is any entity that performs a role on the system. 
- This could be, 
	users or organizations who interact with the system,
	external software interacting with the system,
	Hardware devices like sensors, printers that interact with the system.
- Usually drawn like skeleton. 
	![[Pasted image 20240630183541.png]]
- Actors initiate use cases and receive results from the system.
##### 2. Use Case
- A use case represents a functionalities which system offers.
- It's drawn as an oval and names within the function.

##### 3. System
- The system is the software application or product you're modeling.
- The system boundary is a rectangle that encloses all the use cases within the system's scope.
##### 4. Relationships
Actors and use cases are connected by lines in a UML diagram. This shows which actors interact with which use case. 
Types of relationships,
1. **Association between an actor and a use case.**
2. **Generalization of an actor**
3. **Include**
4. **Extends**

##### 4.1 Association between an actors and a use case.
An actor must be associated with at least one use case.
An actor can be associated with multiple use cases. 
Multiple actors can be associated with a single use case.

##### 4.2 Generalization of actors
An actor can inherits the role of the other actor.
The descendant inherits all the use cases of the ancestor.
The descendant has one or more use cases that are specific to that role.

##### 4.3 Extends
One use case extends the functionality of another use case under specific conditions. It ==represents optional behavior.==
![[Pasted image 20240630192941.png]]
	If only amount is over 10,000 or age is over 55, that customer is eligible to have the bonus. 

> [!NOTE] Extending vs. Extended
> - **Extending Use case** : Use case that adds optional functionality to another use case (the extended use case) under specific conditions.
> - **Extended Use Case**(base) : The core use case that has its functionality potentially augmented by the extending use case.

- It extends the base use case and adds more functionality to the system.
- The **extending use case**(calculate bonus) is dependent on the **extended**(base - deposit funds) use case. 
- The *extending use case is usually optional* and can be triggered conditionally. 
- The extended(base) use case must be meaningful on its own.
##### 4.4 Include
One use case includes the functionality of another use case. It ==represents common behavior.==
> [!NOTE] Include vs. Including
> - **Include Use Case** : This is a use case that provides a specific functionality which is reused by other use cases. It represents a common set of steps that multiple use cases share.
> - **Including Use Case**(base) : This is the use case that incorporates the functionality of the included use case.

The main reason for this is to reuse the common actions across multiple use cases.

### Software Requirement Document
AKA "Software Requirement Specification" or SRS.
This is an official statement of what the system developers should implement. This document includes both user requirements and system requirements. Requirements documents are essential when systems are outsourced for development, when different teams develop different parts of the system, and when a detailed analysis of the requirements is mandatory.

**Users of a Requirement document,**
1. System customers
	Read the SRS documents to check that the meet their needs. Customers specify changes to the requirements. Then specify changes to the requirements. 
2. Managers
	Use the requirements document to plan a bid for the system and to plan the system development process.
3. System Engineers
	Use the requirements document to understand what system is to be developed. 
4. System test engineers
	Use the requirements to understand what system is to be develop. 
5. System test engineers
	Use the requirements document to develop validation tests for the system.

### Software Requirement Specification
The level of detail that you should include in a requirements document depends on the type of system that is being developed and the development process used.
	Critical systems need detailed requirements because safety and security have to be analyzed in detail to find possible requirements errors.
	When the system is to be developed by a separate company (ex: through outsourcing), the system specifications need to be detailed and precise.

Structure of a SRS,
1. Preface
	Defines the expected readership of the document and describe its version history, including a summary of the changes made in each version.
2. Introduction
	Defines the need for the system.
	Briefly describe the system's functions and explain how it will work with other system. 
	Describe how the system fits into the overall business or strategic objectives of the organization.
1. Glossary
	Defines the technical terms used in the document.
2. User requirement definition
	Describe the services provided for the user using a natural language with diagrams or other notations. 
	Also specify product and process standards.
1. System architecture
	A high-level overview of the anticipated system architecture.
	Shows the distribution of functions across system modules.
	Architectural components that are reused should be highlighted.
1. System requirement specification
	Describes the functional and nonfunctional requirements in more detail.
	If necessary, further detail may also be added to the nonfunctional requirements. 
	Interfaces to other systems may be defined.
1. System models
	Includes graphical system models showing the relationships between the system components and the system and its environment.
	Ex: object models, data-flow models, semantic data models
1. System evolution
	Describes the fundamental assumptions on which the system is based, and any anticipated changes due to hardware evolution, changing user needs, and so on.
	This section is useful for system designers as it may help them avoid design decisions that would constrain likely future changes to the system.
1. Appendices
	Provide detailed information and/or specific information that is related to the application being developed. 
	Ex: hardware and database descriptions.
