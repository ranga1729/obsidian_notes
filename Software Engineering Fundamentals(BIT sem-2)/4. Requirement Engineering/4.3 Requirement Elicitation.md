This is the initial phase where you actively gather information to understand the work that stakeholders do and how they might use a new system to help support that work. 

During the requirement elicitation, software engineers work with stakeholder to find out about the
	application domain
	work activities
	services
	system features
that stakeholders want and the 
	required performance
	hardware constraints
and so on.

#### Problems of Requirement Analysis
- Stakeholders don't know what they really want
- Stakeholders express requirements in their own terms.
- Conflicts about requirements between stakeholders.
- Influence of the organizational and political factors to the requirements. 
- Requirements get change during the analysis.
	new stakeholders emerge
	business environment get changes

#### Approaches to Requirement Elicitations,
1. **Interviewing**
	Talk to people about what they do.
2. **Observation or Ethnography**
	Watch people doing their job

*Mix of interviewing and observing is used to collect information and then derive the requirements.*

##### 1. Interviewing
Formal or informal interviews with stakeholders are part of most Requirement Engineering process.

Types of interviews,
1. Closed Interview : based on pre-determined list of questions
2. Open Interview : where various issues are explored with stakeholders.

Tips to effective interviewing,
- Be open minded
	Avoid pre-conceived ideas about the requirements and are willing to listen to stakeholders. 
- prompt the interviewee to get discussions going by using a springboard question, a requirements proposal or by working together on a prototype system. 

Practical interviews are a mix of ==closed and open-ended== interviews.
Interviews are good to get a overall understanding but they are not good for understanding domain requirements. 
	Requirement Engineers cannot understand specific domain terminology. 
	Some domain knowledge is so familiar that people find it hard to clear or think that it isn’t worth articulating.
##### 2. Ethnography
Ethnography is an observational technique that can be used to understand operational process and help derive requirements for a software. 

Ethnography allows requirement engineers to observe users in their natural environment. 
An analyst immerses himself in the working environment and day-to-day work is observed and notes are made. 
This provides a deeper understanding of how they actually work, the challenges they face, and the context in which they'll be using the system. 
Ex: 
	Studying chefs in a restaurant kitchen to understand their workflow before designing a new kitchen management system.

**Scenarios vs. Stories**
*Scenarios*
- Scenarios are events or interactions a user might have with the system within a particular context observed during the ethnography research. 
- They provide concrete examples of how the system might be used. And also they provide a clear picture of the user's goals, actions, the system's response, and the overall context.
Scenarios Usually structured with specific information collected. (ex: inputs and outputs)
Scenarios may include,
	A description of the system
	User's expectation when the scenario starts.
	Normal flow of events in the scenario.
	A description of what can go wrong and how results can be handled.
	Other activities going on at the same time with the scenario. 
	System state at the end of the scenario.

*Stories*
- Stories are user's overall experience with a system or process within the observed context written in narrative text and present as high-level descriptions. 
- They might encompass multiple scenarios and highlight the user's challenges, motivations, and pain points.
- Stories help requirement engineers understand the user's perspective on a deeper level. They go beyond the functionality of the system and reveal the human element – the user's needs, desires, and frustrations.
