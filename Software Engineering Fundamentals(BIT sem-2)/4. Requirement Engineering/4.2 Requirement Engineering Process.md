Key activities,
1. **Requirement elicitation and analysis**
	Discover requirements by interacting with stakeholders.
2. **Requirements specification**
	Converting gathered requirements into standard forms.
3. **Requirement validation**
	Checking the requirements actually define the system that the customer wants.

- In practice, Requirement Engineering is an iterative process process in which these processes are interleaved.
