### Functional Requirements
*Explain what the system is suppose to to do and features it should offer* instead of how they will be achieved.
- Defined using user-centric viewpoint.
- Action-oriented : clear and concise, outlining what the system should do under specific conditions
Functional requirements are high-level statements of what the system should do and they are written in natural language so users and managers can understand them.
Functional requirements expand the user requirements and are written for system developers. 

Ex: **Metcare system** : A system used to maintain information about patience who receives treatments for mental health problems. 
*Functional requirements,*
1. A user shall be able to search the appointment lists for all clinics.
2. The system shall generate each day, for each clinic, a list of patients who are expected to attend appointments that day.
3. Each staff member using the system shall be uniquely identified by his or her 9-digit employee number.

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe the characteristics and constraints that define how a system should behave, rather than what it should do. 

> [!NOTE] In other words
> Non-functional requirements are not directly concerned with the specific services delivered by the system to its users. They specify the system's quality characteristics or quality attributes.

List of non-functional requirements
	Performance (ex: response time, throughput, utilization, static volumetric)
	Usability (how difficult it will be learn and operate the system)
	Security & Safety(protection of the system and its data)
	Reliability (software fails under certain conditions)
	Scalability
	Capacity
	Availability (uptime vs downtime)
	Recoverbility
	Maintainability
	Confidentiality
	Environmental effects
	Interoperability (ability to exchange information and communication with internal and external applications and systems)
	Accuracy and Precision(Data Integrity)
	Potability
	Legality (ex: privacy information, intellectual property rights, export restricted technologies)
Non-functional requirements apply to the system as a whole and consider various aspects of its design and development. They can address,
	user experience
	system maintainability
	operational efficiency
	legal or regulatory considerations.

#### Classifications of Non-functional requirements
1. **Product Requirements**
	Specify constraints and runtime behavior of the software or inherent characteristics and functionalities of the system itself.
	Ex:
		Performance requirements : required system speed, required  memory capacity
		Reliability requirements : acceptable failure rate
		Security requirements
		Usability requirement
2. **Organizational Requirements**
	Broad system requirements derived from policies and procedures in the organization. 
	Ex:
		Operational process requirements : define how the system will be used
		Development process requirements : specify the programming language
3. **External Requirements**
	Broad heading covers all requirements that are derived from factors external and its development process. 
	Ex:
		Regulatory Requirements : to be approved for use by a regulator(ex: nuclear safety authority)
		Legislative Requirements : to ensure the system operates within the law
		Ethical requirements : make sure system is acceptable to users and general public

Ex: **Metcare system** : A system used to maintain information about patience who receives treatments for mental health problems. 
1. Product requirements
	- System shall be available to all clinics during normal working hours.(Mon-Fri, 08:30-17:30)
	- Down time within normal working hours shall not exceed 5 seconds in any one day.
2. Organizational requirements
	- Users shall identify themselves using their health authority identity card.
3. External requirements
	- system shall implement patient privacy provisions as set out in HStan-03-2006-priv.
