## 1. AWS Kye Management Service(AWS KMS)
![[Pasted image 20230831114203.png]]
- AWS KMS enables you to perform encryption operations through the use of **cryptographic keys**. 
	A cryptographic key is a random string of digits used for locking(encrypting) and unlocking(decrypting) data. 
- You can control the use of keys across a wide range of services and in your applications.
	Ex: Amazon DynamoDB
- You can choose the specific levels of access control you need for your keys. 
	Ex: Specify which IAM users and roles are able to manage keys. 
- Data encryptions are important,
	1. while data in storage (Encryption at rest)
	2. while data is transmitted (Encryption in transit)

To protect data while traveling, AWS services including SQS, S3, RDS and many more, uses **Secure Socket Layer(SSL)** or SSL Connections to encrypt data and we can use service certificates to validate and authorize a client.

## 2. Amazon Inspector
![[Pasted image 20230831120219.png]]
Amazon Inspector runs an automated security assessment against your infrastructure. 
- It helps to check,
	1. Deviation of best practices.
	3. Exposure of EC2 instances.
	4. Vulnerabilities and etc...
- This service consist of three parts,
	1. A network configuration reachability piece
	2. Amazon agent
		Can be installed on EC2 instances
	3. Security assessment service.
		Connect everything together. 

## 3. Amazon GuardDuty
![[Pasted image 20230831120925.png]]
Amazon GuardDuty analyzes continuous stream of metadata generated from your account, and network activity found on AWS CloudTrail events, Amazon VPC Flow Logs and DNS logs.
	simply monitor your network and account activity.
- It uses integrated threat intelligence.
	such as malicious IP addresses, anomaly detections and machine learning to identify threats more accurately.
- It runs independently from your other services so it won't affect performance or availability of your existing infrastructure and workloads.

## 4. AWS WAF
- AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor network requests that come into your web applications. 
- AWS WAF works together with Amazon CloudFront and an Application Load Balancer.
-  AWS WAF works in a similar way to block or allow traffic. However, it does this by using a **web access control list (ACL)** to protect your AWS resources.
- When a request comes into AWS WAF, it checks against the list of rules that you have configured in the web ACL. If a request did not come from one of the blocked IP addresses, it allows access to the application.
- However, if a request came from one of the blocked IP addresses that you have specified in the web ACL, it is denied access.
