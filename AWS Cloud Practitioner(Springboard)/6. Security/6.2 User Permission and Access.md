- When you create an AWS account, you are given what is called the **root user**. 
	The owner of the AWS account. 
	Has full access control to any resource in the account.
	Recommended to use MFA(Multi Factor Authentication) to secure the root account.
- Other employees doesn't need that level of access. 

**Best Practice :**
- Do not use the root user for everyday tasks.
	use the root user to create your first IAM user and assign it permissions to create other users.
	Then, continue to create other IAM users

## AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM)

### IAM Users
- With IAM, you can create IAM users. It represents the person or application that interacts with AWS services and resources. It consists of a name and credentials.
	By default, newly created IAM users has no permissions to do anything. 
	Users can't even log into the AWS account at first.
	Root user has to explicitly give the user permissions.

**Best Practice :**
- Create one User account for one employee even they have require same level of access.

- You give people access only to what they need and nothing else. 
	This idea is called **"The Least Privilege Principle".**
- The way of grant or deny permission to users is called **an IAM policy to an IAM user.**
	An IAM Policy is a JSON document that describes what API calls a user can or cannot make.

	This user can view the bucket "coffe_shop_reports" but no other actions granted.
		Effect : Allow/Deny
		Actions : list any AWS API call
		Resource : list any AWS resource that API call is for.

### IAM Groups
Instead of configuring every permissions that each employee require individually, you can create IAM groups with permissions which you can then add employees to relevant groups to give them access all at once.
	Ex: Instead of individually granting access to the register for every cashiers in the business, You can grant all cashier access to a IAM Group called "Cashiers" and add each individual cashier to the group.

### Roles
- Roles are identities in the AWS IAM, which have associated permissions within temporary amount of time. 
	When the employee needs to switch to a different task, they give up their access to one workstation and gain access to the next workstation. The employee can easily switch between workstations, but at any given point in time, they can have access to only a single workstation.

- Similar to a User, but has no username and password. 
- You can use roles to temporarily grant access to AWS resource to user, external identities, applications, and even other AWS services. 
- It abandon all of the previous permissions that it has and it assumed the permission of that role.

Example:
	1. Owner grants employee permissions to switch to a role for each workstation.
	2. Let's assume the employee begin their day as a "cashier". This grants him access to the cash register.
	3. Later, the employee needs to update the inventory system. They assume the "Inventory" role. This grants the employee access to the inventory system and also revoke their access to the cash register system.

You can avoid creating IAM users for every person in your organization by federating users into your account. This means that they could use their regular corporate credentials to log into AWS by mapping their corporate identities to IAM roles.
