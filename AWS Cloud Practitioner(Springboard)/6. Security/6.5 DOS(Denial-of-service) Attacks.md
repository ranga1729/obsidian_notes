## DoS(Denial-of-Service)
A DOS attack is flooding a website or application with network traffic until the targeted website or application becomes overloaded and is no longer able to respond. 

## DDoS(Distributed Denial-of-service)
When multiple sources are used to initiate a DoS attack, it's called a DDoS.
This can come from a group of attackers, or even a single attacker with multiple infected computers(bots/zombies).

Types of DoS attacks are incliding,
	1. UDP Flood
	2. HTTP Attacks
	3. Slowloris Attacks

### 1. UDP Flood
When you request data from a online service(Ex: A weather service), the service return you the information(data traffic) you requested for. 

Attackers request data from other online services, but they make that return traffic goes to the target.

### 2. HTTPS Attacks

It looks like normal customers asking for normal searches over and over again. All network traffic is coming from bots. 

### 3. Slowloris Attacks
![[Pasted image 20230831101928.png]]
The attacker pretends to have a terrible slow connection, So your production servers are standing thee waiting for the fake customer(attacker) to finish their request. 
	Because until the server get the entire data packet they can't move on to the next thread/customer. 


### Solutions
1) Security Groups prevents UDP Floods
	![[Pasted image 20230831102319.png]]
	Security groups only allow in proper request traffic. Since security groups operate at the AWS network level(not the EC2 instance level), massive attacks like UDP floods or reflections attacks get shrugged off by the scale of the entire AWS regions capacity.
	
2. Elastic Load Balancer(ELB) prevents Slowloris Attacks
	![[Pasted image 20230831103000.png]]
	Because the ELB handles the HTTP traffic first, so it waits until the entire message reach into the ELB, no matter how slow or fast it is. 
	Since ELB runs on regional level and scales to match to the traffic, attacker has to overwhelm the entire AWS region which is not so easy.

## AWS Shield
![[Pasted image 20230831103627.png]]
AWS Shield uses Web Application Firewall(WAF) to filter incoming traffic for the signature of bad actors.
- AWS Shield uses extensive machine learning capabilities and can recognize new threats as they evolve and proactively help defend your system.

AWS Shield provides two levels of protection,
	1. AWS Shield Standard
	2. AWS Shield Advanced

### AWS Shield Standard
AWS Shield Standard automatically protects all AWS customers at no cost from the most common, frequently occurring types of DDoS attacks. 

### AWS Shield Advanced
AWS Shield Advanced is a paid service that provides detailed attack diagnostic and the ability to detect mitigate sophisticated DDoS attacks. 
- It also integrates with other services such as Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Route 53, and Elastic Load Balancing.
- You can integrate AWS Shield with AWS WAF by writing custom rules to mitigate complex DDoS attacks.
