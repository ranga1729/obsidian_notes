The shared responsibility model divides into customer responsibilities (commonly referred to as “security in the cloud”) and AWS responsibilities (commonly referred to as “security of the cloud”).

- Customer responsible for the security 'in' the cloud.
	Everything that they create and put in the AWS cloud.
- AWS responsible for the security 'of' the cloud.
	Ex: For an EC2 instance.

-  AWS is responsible for the  Physical security, Network security and the safety of some underlying technologies like Hypervisor and virtualization. 
-  Only customer have the encryption key to log onto the root of this OS, customer own and maintain the application runs on top of the OS and you control the access to your data. Since AWS doesn't have backdoors to your system, you are responsible for those things.
