the Well Architected Framework is designed to enable architects, developers and users of AWS to build secure high-performance, resilient and efficient infrastructure for their applications. 

It build upon 6 pillars,
	1. Operational excellence
	2. Security
	3. Reliability
	4. Performance Efficiency
	5. Cost Optimization
	6. Sustainability

### 1. Operational excellence
Focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

Including,
	performing operations as code.
	annotating documentation.
	anticipating failures.
	frequently making small, reversible changes.

Ex: 
	automating changes with deployment pipeline or responding to events that are triggered.
### 2. Security
Ability to protect information, system and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

Ex: 
	Automate security best practices.
	Apply security at layers.
	protecting system by using encryption in data transits and rests. 		
### 3. Reliability
Ability of a system to do,
	1. Recover from infrastructure or service disruption
	2. Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand.
	3. Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations to meet demand.
Ex: 
	Testing recovery procedures
	Scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
	Automatically recovering from failure.
### 4. Performance Efficiency
Ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

Evaluates by
	experimenting more often
	using serverless architectures
	designing systems to be able to go global in minutes.

Ex: using the right EC2 type based on workloads. 
Making informed decisions and maintaining efficiency as business need evolve. 
### 5. Cost Optimization
Ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

Includes,
	adopting a consumption model
	analyzing and attributing expenditures
	using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership

Ex: Checking if you have overestimated your EC2 server size.
### 6. Sustainability
Focuses on minimizing the environmental impact of running cloud workloads.
Reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency are at the core of this pillar. 


You can access the Well Architected Framework tool from the AWS Management Console. 
Create a workload and run it against your AWS account to generate a report showing areas that should be addressed. 
	Green - good
	Orange - room for improvement
	Red - something at risk
