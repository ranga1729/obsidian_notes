## Block-level Storages
"Block-Level Storage" is a technology that is used to store files on **Storage Area Networks(SANs)** or Cloud-based storage environments which Â emulate the behaviours of a traditional block device, such as a physical hard drive. Storage in such services is organized as blocks.

When a file is updated, the whole series of block aren't all overwritten. Instead, it updates just the pieces that change.

Hard Drives we use in laptops are also Block-level storages. 
## Instance Store Volumes

"Instance Store Volume" is the block-level storge you receive when you launch an EC2 instance. 
	Like a local storage for an EC2.
	It depends on the type of EC2 you have choosen.

Since these volumes are physically attached to the underlying host, they have the same lifespan as an EC2. 
	When the EC2 terminated or stopped, all the data written to the Instance Store volumes will be deleted.
	(EC2 instances are virtual machines, so the underlying host can be changed between stopping and starting and instance)

This is useful regarding,
	1. Temporary files
	2. Scratch Data or
	3. data that can be recreated without any consequences. 
## Amazon Elastic Block Store(Amazon EBS)

Amazon EBS is the service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances to persist your files important files.

- With EBs you can create virtual hard drives called **EBS Volumes** which you can attach to your EC2 instances.
- These are separate drives from the local instance store volumes and they aren't tied directly to the host. 
	So Data written to the EBS won't get deleted during a terminations and stops of the EC2 instance.

- EBS volumes comes in different sizes and types.

- EBS allows you to take incremental backups of your data called **Snapshots.** In any scenario you can restore your data from the Snapshot.
	Incremental backups are different from the Full backups.
	In a incremental backup, first backup taken of a volume copies all the data. For subsequent backups, only the blocks of data that have changed since the most recent snapshot are saved.
