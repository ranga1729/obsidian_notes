Amazon DMS enables you to migrate relational databases, nonrelational databases(NoSQL) and other types of data stores.

- AWS DMS moves data between a source database and a target database. 
Source and the target can be same or different types. 

Benefits,
	1. The source database remains fully operational during the migration.
	2. downtime is minimized for applications that rely on that database. 
	3. The source and target database don't have to be of the same type. 

## Homogenous Databases
Migrate data between same type of databases.

Ex: 
	1. MySQL to Amazon RDS for MySQL.
	2. Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon RDS for SQL server.
	3. Oracle to Amazon RDS for Oracle.

Source database can be on,
	1. On-premises database
	2. Amazon EC2
	3. Amazon RDS

Target database can be on,
	1. Amazon EC2
	2. Amazon RDS

In this case you just create a migration task with connection to the source and target database. Then migration starts with a one click. 

## Heterogenous Databases
Migrate data between different types of databases.

Since the,
	Schema structure
	Data types
	Database code are different in this case, first we need to convert them using the **"AWS Schema Conversion Tool"**.
	This will convert Schema Structure and Database code to match the target database.

Then DMS can be used to migrate the data from the source to target database.


## Other use cases of Amazon DMS
1. Development and test database migrations

	Test a something against production data, but without affecting production users. 
	(Use DMS to migrate a copy of your production database to your dev or test environment.)

2. Database consolidation
	![[Pasted image 20230829211721.png]]
	when you want to consolidate several databases into a one central database.

3. Continuous database replication
	![[Pasted image 20230829211907.png]]
	To perform continuous data replications.
	Ex : for disaster recovery or geographic separation.
