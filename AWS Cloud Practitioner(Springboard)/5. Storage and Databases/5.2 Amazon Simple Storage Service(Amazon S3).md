	1. A key
		A unique identifier.

Amazon S3 is a storage service that provides object-level storage.
- Amazon S3 stores data as objects(files) in a buckets(like file directories/folders). 
- Amazon S3 offers unlimited storage space at any scale.
	The maximum file size for an object is 5TB.
- When you upload a file to Amazon S3, you can set permission to control visibility and access to it. 
- You can also use the amazon S3 versioning feature to track changes yo tour objects over time.
- You can stage data in different tiers(classes).
- You pay only for what you use. 

## Amazon S3 storage classes.
Amazon S3 provides Storage classes which has different features.
Consider this factors when you chose a storage class,
	1. How often you plan to retrieve your data.
	2. How available you need your data to be.

Storage classes,
	1. S3 Standard
	2. S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
	3. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
	4. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
	5. S3 Glacier
	6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

## 1. S3 Standard
- Designed for frequently accessed data.
- Stores data in a minimum of three Availability Zones.

- Provides High availability for objects(files).
	Good for wide range of use cases like websites, content distribution, data analytics.
- S3 standard has higher cost than other storage classes intend for infrequently accessed and archival storage.

- S3 standard come with **11 nines of durability.**
which means 99.999999999% of probability.

- Another use case of Amazon S3 is to Host static websites.
	(Static website is a collection of HTML files and each file is akin to a physical page of the actual site.)
	You can simply upload all of the HTML, static web assets into a bucket and then check the box to host it as a static website. 
	Then bucket URL becomes the site's URL.

## 2. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
- Ideal for infrequent accessed data which requires high availability and rapid access when needed.
- Stores data in a minimum of three availability zones.
- similar to S3 standard but has a,
	1. lower storage price and 
	2. higher retrieval price
Ex: store backups, disaster recovery files
## 3. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
- Stores data in a single Availability zone. 
- Lower storage price than S3 standard-IA.
	Good plan If you want to save costs on storage. 
- You can reproduce data in the event of an Availability zone failure. 

## 4. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- Ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns.
- require a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object.

- In this class, amazon S3 monitors objects' access patterns. 
	If you haven't accessed an object for 30 consecutive days, amazon S3 automatically moves it to the infrequent access tier(known as **S3 Standard-IA class**).

	If you access an object in the infrequent access tier, Amazon S3 automatically moves it to the frequent access tier(known as **S3 Standard**.)

## Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
![[Pasted image 20230828214710.png]]
Good for store data that need to retain for several years and we don't need it to be retrieve very rapidly.
- To use Glacier Flexible Retrieval, You can simply move data to it, or you can create vaults and then populate them with archives. 
	If you require your data to retain for a certain period of time, you can employ an **S3 Glacier vault lock policy** and lock your vault.
- You can specify **Write once/read many (WORM)** in a **vault lock policy** and lock the policy from future edits. Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed.

### S3 Glacier Flexible with Life Cycle Policy
There are policies you can create that can move data automatically between tiers. 
	Ex: Keep an object in S3 standard for 90 days and then move it to S3 Standard-IA for next 30 days. Then after 120 days total we want to move it to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval.
- You can create those configurations to do them automatically. 
## 5. S3 Glacier
- Low-cost storage designed for data archiving.
- Able to retrieve objects within a few minutes to hours.
	Good to store archived customer records or older photos and video files.

## 6. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- Lowest cost object storage class ideal for archiving 
- Able to retrieve objects within 12 hours

when choosing between S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive, consider how quickly you need to retrieve archived objects.
