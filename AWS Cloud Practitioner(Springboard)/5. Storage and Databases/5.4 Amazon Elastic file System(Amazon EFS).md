Amazon EFS is a scalable, shared, managed file system which can be used with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.

- Amazon EFS is a Shared file system.
	You can set up multiple resources working on this data.
	Ex: Multiple EC2 instances running analytics on large amounts of data.
- EFS is scalable. 
	As you add and remove files, EFS grows and shrinks automatically. It can scale up to petabytes without any disrupting. 
- Uses block-level storage. Clients access data through file paths.
