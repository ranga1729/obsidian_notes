Amazon Redshift is a data ware housing service that you can use for dig data analytics. 

"Big data analyzing" is another realm of databases. It's more focused on 'What happened' than 'what's happening'.

Ex: 
RDB/NoSQL applications : 
1. "Show me the count of customers who purchased bubble tea yesterday."
2. "How many coffee bags do we have right now ?"
(Operational Analysis.)

Big Data : 
1. "Show me how production has improved since started."
2. "Show me last hour's sales numbers across all the stores."
(Historical Analysis.)

In this type of scenarios,
	1. The data collection never stops.
	2. With modern telemetry and IoTs the volume of data is overwhelmingly large.
	3. There may be varieties of data.
		Ex: Inventory data, Financial data, sales data
		(Big data analyzing tool can analyze multiple databases with a single query, but RDBMS can not.)

So modern databases that are engineered for highspeed, real time ingestions and queries may not be the best fit for Big data.

Data warehouses are engineered specifically for this kind of big data. 
**As long as your business questions are looking backwards at all** then the data warehouses are the right solution.
Ex: 
	Business Intelligence(BI) Applications

- If you prefer another data warehouse solutions, you can run them on AWS.
	You have to manage warehouse tuning, resilient and continuous scaling.

Redshift is a **"Data warehousing as a service"** type of service. 
- It's massively scalable. 
- Redshift nodes are in multiple petabyte sizes.
- By using **Amazon Redshift Spectrum** you can directly run a single SQL query against exabytes of unstructured data running in data lakes.
- Redshift provide variety of innovations that allows you to achieve up to 10 times higher performance than traditional databases.
