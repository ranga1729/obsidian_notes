## S3
1. Web enabled
	Every object has a URL.
	Able to Control access.
2. Regionally distributed
	11 nines durability.
3. Offers Cost savings. 
4. Serverless.
	No EC2 instances are needed to use S3 storages.
5. Object-level storage
	Store files as a whole object it self.
	
**If you are using completely objects or occasional changes, S3 is ideal.**
## EBS
1. Block-level storage
	store files as small components called blocks.
	When making changes to files, only the changed bits are updating, Not the whole file. 
	
Ex: you are editing a 80GB video file. 
If you are using Object storage, you have to update the entire file. 
If you are using a block storage, since 8GB is stored as small components, only the changed bits will be updated.  

**If you are doing complex, read/write functions, then EBS is ideal.
