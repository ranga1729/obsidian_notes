Let's assume you are running you business in the Tokyo Region, But you also have a customer base in Mumbai. 

Instead of require your Mumbai customers to access data from Tokyo, the origin source, which can cause a much latency, you can place a copy locally or cache a copy in Mumbai.

Caching copies of data closer to the customers all around the world uses the concept of **'Content Delivery Networks'** or **"CDN"**.  
CDNs in Amazon are called **"Amazon Cloud Front".

**Edge Locations** are sites/places (separated from regions) that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to the customer for faster delivery. 

AWS Edge Locations run more services than CloudFront.
Ex: Domain Name Service(DNS) known as **"Amazon Route 53"**
