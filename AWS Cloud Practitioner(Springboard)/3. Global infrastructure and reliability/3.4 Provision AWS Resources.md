In AWS, everything is a APIs, Which means there are predetermined ways for you to interacts with AWS services. You can invoke or call these APIs to provision, configure, and manage your AWS resources.

API = Application Programming Interface

You can interact with AWS APIs/services using 3 methods,
	1. AWS Management Console
	2. AWS Command line (AWS CLI)
	3. AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs)
	4. Other tools (Ex: AWS CloudFormation)

## 1. AWS Management Console
![[Pasted image 20230826112859.png]]
AWS Management Console is a web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services in a visual way. 

You can use the AWS mobile application for the same purpose. 
useful for :
- Building test environments
- Viewing AWS bills.
- Monitoring and working with other non-technical resources. 

## 2. AWS CLI
**Once you are up and running in a production type environment, You don't have to rely on web based consoles. You can use AWS Command Line Interface.

CLI allows you to make API calls using the terminal on your machine. And you can repeatedly use those commands to do things and reduce the human errors by using scripts.

AWS CLI is Available for,
	1. Windows
	2. macOS
	3. Linux

By using CLI, you can automate the actions that your services and applications perform through scripts. 
	Ex: 
	1. Launch Amazon EC2 instances.
	2. Connect an Amazon EC2 instance to a specific autoscaling group.
And you can make scripts run automatically on schedules or triggered by another process.

## 3. AWS SDKs
AWS SDKs allows you to interact with AWS resources through various programming languages.
This makes it easy for developers to create programs that use AWS without using the low level APIs. 
Supported languages including,
	1. C++
	2. Java
	3. .NET and more.

## 4. Other Tools
You can manage your AWS environment using managed tools. 
Ex: 
	1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk
	2. AWS CloudFormation

### 1. AWS Beanstalk
![[Pasted image 20230826185717.png]]
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk helps you provision Amazon EC2 based environments.
- You can provide your application code and desired configurations to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service, which then takes that information and build out your environment for you. 
	It will perform these tasks,
	1. Adjust capacity
	2. Load balancing
	3. Automatic scaling
	4. Application health monitoring
- It allows you to save environment configuration, so they can be deployed again. 

### 2. AWS CloudFormation
![[Pasted image 20230826190350.png]]
- AWS CloudFormation is a **"Infrastructure as a Code"** tool. 
- This allows you to define a wide variety of AWS resources in a declarative way using JSON or YAML text-based documents called **"CloudFormation Templates"**.
- CloudFormation lets you define what you want without specifying the details of exactly how to build, the CloudFormation engine will do that API calling part for you.

- CloudFormation isn't limited to  EC2 based solutions. It's supports many resources including,
	1. Storage
	2. Databases
	3. Analytics
	4. Machine Learning and more.
- You can run the same CloudFormation template in multiple accounts or multiple regions and it will create identical environments across them. (It reduce the human errors, and automate the process.)
