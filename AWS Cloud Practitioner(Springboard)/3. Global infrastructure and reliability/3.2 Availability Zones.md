An "Availability Zone"(AZ) is a single data center or a group of data centers within a region.

availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other. If a disaster occurs in one part of the Region, they are distant enough to reduce the chance that multiple Availability Zones are affected.

Ex: 
Let's assume you are running an EC2 instance in the Northern California region(us-west-1a) availability zone, you would loose you instance if that AZ get failed. 

## Best Practice: 
Run applications across at least two Availability Zones in a Region.
In this example, you might choose to run a second Amazon EC2 instance in us-west-1b.

If us-west-1a were to fail, your application would still be running in us-west-1b.

* **Many of the AWS services run at the Regional level, means they run synchronously across multiple AZs without any additional effort on your part.**
	Ex: ELB is a regional construct. It runs across all availability zones, communicating with the EC2 instances that are running in a specific availability zone. 

	**Any service that listed as a "Regional scoped service"(Regional Services) are by definition already highly available.
