A load balancer is a application that takes in requests and routes them to the instance to be processed. 
"Elastic Load Balancing"(ELB) is the AWS service which uses to load balance in AWS systems.

A load balancer act as a single point of contact for all incoming web traffic to your Auto scaling group. While you add or remove EC2 instances to responds to the incoming traffic, these requests route to the load balancer first. Then the requests spread across multiple resources that will handle them. 

Elastic Load Balancing and EC2 Auto Scaling are separate services.

- ELB is a regional construct. (Means it runs region level rather than on individual EC2 instances.) ELB is automatically highly available.
- ELB is automatically scalable. 
	As your traffic grow, ELB is designed to handle the additional throughput with no change to the hourly cost. 
	
	When your EC2 fleets scales up, as each instance comes online, the "Auto Scaling Service" just lets the Elastic Load Balancing service know that it's ready to handle the traffic.

	Once the fleet scales out, ELB first stops all the new traffic, and waits for the existing request to complete.
	Once they do that, the 'Auto Scaling service' can terminate the additional instances.

- ELB is not only used for external traffic but also for internal traffic.
	Let's see how ELB handles the back end traffic.

	![[backend - frontend traffic with elb.png]] After using ELB.
	Since the ELB is regional, it's single URL that each front end instance uses. Then the ELB directs traffic to the back end that has the least outstanding requests. 
	
	Even when a new back end instance come online to handle the traffic, it just tells the ELB that new back end instance is ready.

	Then it takes traffic as usual. Front end instances doesn't know and doesn't care how many back end instances are running.
