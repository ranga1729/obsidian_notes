**"Messaging and Queueing"** is the idea of placing messages into a buffer.

When applications communicate directly, it's called a **"Tightly coupled Architecture"**.

The issue with the tightly coupled architecture is, when a single component fails or changes, it causes issues for other components or even the whole system.

The more reliable architecture is **"Loosely Coupled Architecture"**. (If a one component fails, it is isolated and therefore won't cause cascading failures throughout the system.)

To make this system a loosely coupled architecture, we can introduce a buffer between application A and B. This buffer is a message queue.

- Messages are sent into the queue by application A.
- Message queue act as a buffer.

If application B fails, message queue will hold the messages until application B gets work. Since that, Application A won't experience any disruption.

## 1. Amazon  Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)
![[Amazon SQS.png]]
Amazon SQS allows you to,
	1. Send 
	2. Store
	3. Receive messages Between software components at any volume. 

- The data contained within a message is called a payload and it is protected until delivery. 
- SQS Queues are where messages are placed until they are processed. (AWS manages the underlying infrastructure for you to host the queues.)
- Amazon SQS scales automatically and reliable and easy to configure.

## 2. Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)

Amazon SNS is Similar to SQS in the way that it send out messages to services, but it also can send out notifications to end users.
It uses a "**publish/subscribe**" (pub/sub) model.

- You can create a SNS topic which is a channel for messages to be delivered. 
- Then you can configure subscribers to that topic.
- Then you can send messages to the topic which will fan out to all the subscribers in a single go.
- These subscribers can be endpoints such as SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions and HTTP or HTTPS web hooks. 
- Additionally SNS can be used to send notification to end users using mobile push, SMS and emails.
