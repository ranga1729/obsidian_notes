## 1. Monolithic Applications
Application are made of multiple components. The components communicate each other to transmit data, fulfill requests and keep applications running. 
If a application have a tightly coupled components, including databases, servers, the user interfaces, business logic and so on, this type of architecture is called a **"Monolithic Application"** 

If a single component fails, other components get fails and possibly the entire application fails.

## 2. Microservices
To help maintain a application availability when a single component fails, you can design your application through a microservices approach. 

In a microservices approach, application components are loosely coupled. If a single component fails, other component continue to work. 
(The loose coupling prevents the entire application from failing.)

Ex: Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS
