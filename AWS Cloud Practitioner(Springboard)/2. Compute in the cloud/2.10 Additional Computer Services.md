Serverless means you cannot actually see or access the underlying infrastructure or instances that are hosting your applications. All the management of the underlying environment from a provisioning, scaling, high availability and maintenance perspective are taken care for you.

## 1. AWS Lambda

Lambda is one serverless compute option.

- Lambda allows you to upload your code into what's called a **"Lambda Function"**. 
- Then you have to configure a "Trigger". 
- When the trigger is detected, the code is automatically run in a managed environment, which you don't need to worry about. 
	because it's automatically scalable, highly available, and all other maintenance in the environment are done by AWS.

Ex: A simple Lambda function might involve automatically resizing uploaded images to the AWS Cloud. In this case, the function triggers when uploading a new image.

- Even you have 1000 incoming triggers, Lambda will scale your function the meet the demand. 
- AWS Lambda is designed to run code under 15 minutes. 
- Suits for quick processing like,
	1. web backend
	2. Handling requests
	3. backend expense report processing service
- you pay only for the compute time that you consume. Charges apply only when your code is running.

## 2. Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)

If you prefer serverless instances but same time you want access to the underlying environment, but still want efficiency and portability, these are services you are looking for.

Both of these services are **"Container Orchestration Tools"** 
A container in this case is a "Docker Container".

Docker is a platform that uses operating system level virtualization to deliver software in containers.
A container is act like a package for your code. You package up you code/application, dependencies and any configurations that it need to run. 

These containers run on EC2 instances and run in isolation from each other.
	This is similar how virtual machines work, but the difference is the host is an EC2 instance.

When you use a Docker container on AWS, you have to start, stop, restart and monitor containers running across not just one EC2 instance, but a number of them together which is called a **cluster.**
The process of doing this tasks called **"Container Orchestration"**.

This orchestration tools were created to help you manage your containers. 

- ECS is designed to help you run your containerized applications at scale without the hassle. 
- EKS does a similar thing, but uses different tooling and with different features. 
- Both ECS and EKS can run on EC2. 


## 3. AWS Fargate

If you don't want to deal with EC2s to host you containers because you either don't need access to the underlying OS or you don't want to manage those EC2 instances, you can use a compute platform called **"AWS Fargate".** 

Fargate is a serverless compute platform for EKS and ECS.
