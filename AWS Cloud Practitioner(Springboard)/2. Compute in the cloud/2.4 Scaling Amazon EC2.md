"Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling" is the service that AWS provides you to scale automatically your EC2 host.
This service enable you to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to changing application demand.
This means that every minutes of the day, you always have the correct number of instances. 

Two options to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling,
	1. Dynamic Scaling
	2. Predictive Scaling

## 1. Dynamic Scaling
Responds to changing of demand.

## 2. Predictive Scaling
Automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.

When configuring the "Auto Scaling Group", you have to set three parameters,
	1. Minimum capacity
		This is the number of amazon instances that launch immediately after you have created the auto scaling group. 
	2. Desired Capacity
		You can set a average number of instances you need as desired capacity. If you don't set this, desired capacity will be set to minimum capacity by default.
	3. Maximum capacity

- You pay only for the instances you use, when you use them.
