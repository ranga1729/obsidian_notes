# Amazon Virtual Private cloud (VPC)
![[Pasted image 20230826210132.png]]
- Amazon VPC allows you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network (VPN) that you define. 
- These resource can be,
	1. Public facing (with internet access)
		public websites
	1. Private facing (without internet access)
		backend services, databases, application servers
- This public/private grouping of resources are known as subnets. 
	In other words, A subnet is a section of a VPC(a range of IPs) that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances. 
	VPC allows you to define your private IP range for your AWS resources like EC2 instances, ELBs.

## Internet Gateway
To allow public traffic from the internet to access your VPC, you attach an internet gateway to the VPC. 
It works as a connection between a VPC and the internet. 

## Virtual Private Gateway
What if you have a VPC that includes only private resources ?
- The Virtual private gateway is the component that allows protected internet traffic to enter into the VPC. 
- A virtual private gateway enables you to establish a virtual network (VPN) connection between your VPC and a private network.
	 A virtual private gateway allows traffic into the VPC only if it is coming from an approved network.
	Ex: On-premises data center or internal corporate network connects with a VPC.

## Public Facing Resources

In order to allow traffic from the public internet to flow into and out of your VPC, you must attach what internet gateway(IGW).
	Like a doorway that's open to the public.

## Private Facing Resources

Virtual Private Gateway allows people in if they are coming from an approved network(Private Traffic), not the public internet. 
	Like a PIN locked doorway. Only people who knows the right PIN can come through the door. 


VPN(Virtual Private Networks) connections are encrypted, but they are still use a regular internet connection that has bandwidth that is being shared by many people using the internet.

To create a totally separated network with AWS, use **"AWS Direct Connect"**.

## AWS Direct Connect

**Direct Connect** allows you to Establish a completely private dedicated fiber connection from your data center to AWS.

It's a physical line that connects your network to your AWS VPC. 
To establish a Direct connect you have to work with the Direct Connect Partner in your area. 

**One VPC might have multiple types of gateways attached for multiple types for multiple resources. all residing in the same VPC just in different subnets.
