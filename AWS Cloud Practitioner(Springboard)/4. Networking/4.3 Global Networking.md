## Domain Name System (DNS)
DNS translates website names into IP(Internet Protocols) addresses that computer can read.
"DNS Resolution" is the process of translating a domain name to an IP address.

when someone type a website domain name and hit enter, 
1. This request is sent to a DNS server.
2. The DNS server asks the web server for the IP address.
3. The web server responds by providing the IP address. 

## Amazon Route 53
![[Pasted image 20230827225928.png]]
- Amazon Route 53 is the AWS's DNS web service.
- It's,
	1. Highly available and
	2. scalable
- Route 53 can direct traffic to different endpoints using several routing policies,
	1. Latency-based routing
	2. Geolocation DNS
	3. Geo Proximity routing
	4. Weighted round robin
	Ex: Geolocation DNS policy means AWS route 53 direct traffic based on where the customer is located.
	Traffic coming from North America routes to  the Oregon region.
	Traffic coming from Ireland routes to the Dublin region.

- Amazon Route 53 connects user request to infrastructure running in AWS such as Amazon EC2 instances and load balancer. 

- You can use Amazon Route 53 to register domain names, So you can buy and manage your own domain names right on AWS.
	And you can transfer DNS records for existing domain names managed by other domain registrars. 

## How Amazon Route 53 and Amazon CloudFront deliver content. 
- Amazon CloudFront is the CDN(Content Delivery Network) of Amazon which uses Edge location to provide responses to user request quickly.

Suppose that XYZ company's application is running on several Amazon EC2 instances. These instances are in an auto scaling group that attaches to an Application Load Balancer.


1. A customer requests data from the application by going to XYZ company's website.
2. Amazon Route 53 uses DNS resolutions to identify xyz.com 's corresponding IP address.
	let's say the IP is 192.0.2.0
3. This information is sent back to the customer. 
4. The customer's request is sent to the nearest location through Amazon CloudFront. 
5. Amazon CloudFront connects to the application load balancer, which sends the incoming data packets to an Amazon EC2 instance.
