VPC security levels,
	1. Network hardening
	2. Application security
	3. User identity
	4. Authentication and authorization
	5. DDOS prevention
	6. Data integrity
	7. Encryption

## Subnets
A subnet is a section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs. 
![[Pasted image 20230827022820.png]]
Subnets can be,
	1. Public subnets
		contain resources that needs to be accessible by the public.
	1. Private subnets
		contain resources that needs to be accessible by the public.
- In a VPC, subnets can communicate with each other. 
	Ex: EC2 instances in a public subnet communicating with databases that are located in a private subnet.
## Data Packets
A packet is a unit of data sent over the internet or a network. 
When a customer request data from an application hosted in the AWS cloud, this request is sent as a packet.
![[Pasted image 20230827023220.png]]
Data packets enters to a VPC through an internet gateway. 
Before a packet can enter into a subnet or exit from a subnet, it checks for permissions. 
These permissions indicates,
	1. who sent the packet
	2. How the packet is trying to communicate with the resources in a subnet.
The VPS component that checks packet permissions for the subnet is a **"Network Access Control List"** or **ACL/Network ACL**.

## Network Access Control List (Network ACL)
- A network access control list (ACL) is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
- It checks the data packets came through the Internet Gateway to the subnet. 
- AWS accounts' default network ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic, but you can modify it by adding your own rules. 
- For custom network ACLS, all inbound and outbound traffic is denied until you add rules to specify which traffic to allow.
- All network ACLs have an **Explicit Deny Rule**. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn’t match any of the other rules on the list, the packet is denied.
	Like a banned/blocked list.

## Security Groups
Network ACL only evaluates packets if it cross the subnet boundary in or out, not in the instance level. 

There may be multiple EC2 instances in the same subnet, but they might have different rules around,
	1. who can send them messages
	2. what port those messages are allowed to be sent to.

That's where "Security Groups" comes to play. 

A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance. 

By default, a security group denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. You can add custom rules to configure which traffic to allow or deny.
	**Security Groups only check inbound traffic to the EC2 not the outbound traffic.**
	All traffic is allowed to out.

So you can modify the security group to accept a specific type of traffic.
	Ex: accept web-based or HTTPS to be accepted but not OS or Admin requests.

- By default, every EC2 instance comes with a security group.
- If you have multiple Amazon EC2 instances within a subnet, you can associate them with the same security group or use different security groups for each instance.

## Difference between Network ACL and Security Groups
![[Pasted image 20230827095434.png]]

Main difference is,
- Network ACLs do "Stateless Packet Filtering"
and
- Security groups do "Stateful Packet Filtering".

## Stateless Packet Filtering
Network ACL perform stateless packet filtering. They remember nothing and check packets that cross the subnet border each way. 

When a packet response for a request comes back to the subnet, the network ACL does not remember your previous request. The network ACL checks the packet response against its list of rules to determine whether to allow or deny.

## Stateful Packet Filtering
Security groups perform **stateful** packet filtering. They remember previous decisions made for incoming packets.

When a packet response for that request returns to the instance, the security group remembers your previous request. The security group allows the response to proceed, regardless of inbound security group rules.


## Sending a data packet 
### 1. From Instance A to Instance B
- Same VPC
- Different subnets.
![[Pasted image 20230827102613.png]]
Steps,
	1. Packet meets the Security group of instance A.
		All outbound traffic is allowed from a security group.
		![[Pasted image 20230827103157.png]]
	2. Packet meets the subnet boundary of subnet 1. 
		Network ACL allow the packet goes out if the packet agrees with with ACL rules.
		![[Pasted image 20230827103337.png]]
	3.  Packet meets the subnet boundary of subnet 2. 
		Network ACL allow the packet goes out if the packet agrees with with ACL rules.
		![[Pasted image 20230827103429.png]]
	4. Packet meets the Security group of instance B.
		Security group check the packet if it's allowed or not.
		![[Pasted image 20230827103624.png]]

### 2. From Instance A to Instance B
- Follow the return path. 
![[Pasted image 20230827103931.png]]
- This is where stateful and stateless packet filtering works.

Steps,
	1. Packet meets the Security group of instance B.
		All outbound traffic is allowed from a security group.
		![[Pasted image 20230827104150.png]]
	2. Packet meets the subnet boundary of subnet 2. 
		Network ACL allow the packet goes out if the packet agrees with with ACL rules.
		![[Pasted image 20230827104238.png]]
	3. Packet meets the subnet boundary of subnet 2. 
			Network ACL allow the packet goes out if the packet agrees with with ACL rules. 
			It's always check it's list.
			*This is stateless packet filtering.*
		![[Pasted image 20230827103337.png]]
	4. Packet meets the Security group of instance A.
		**Security group of instance A recognizes the packet from before, it doesn't need to check.**
		*This is stateful packet filtering.*
