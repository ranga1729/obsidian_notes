In AWS Budget, you can create a budget to plan your service usage, service costs and instance reservations. 
You can also set custom alerts when your usage exceeds (or is forecasted to exceed) the budget amount. 

Ex: Suppose that you have a budget of $200 for an EC2. You want to ensure that your company's usage of the EC2 doesn't exceed $200 for the month.
With AWS Budget, you can set a custom budget to notify you when your usage has reached half (50%) of this amount.
This setting would allow you to receive an alert and decide how you would like to proceed with your continued use of EC2. 

- You can also review comparisons of your,
	1. Current vs. budgeted usage
	2. forecasted vs. budgeted usage
