AWS CloudTrail is a comprehensive API auditing tool which logs every request made to the AWS account.
- Events are typically updated in the CloudTrail within 15 minutes after an API call. You can filter events in the **CloudTrail Event History Section.**

- The engine records exactly,
	1. Who made the request ?
	2. Which operator made the request ?
	3. When did they send the API call ?
	4. Where were they ?
	5. What was their IP ?
	6. What was the response ?
	7. Did something changed ?
	8. What is the new state ?
	9. was the request denied ?
- CloudTrail can save those logs in secure S3 buckets. 

### CloudTrail Insight
