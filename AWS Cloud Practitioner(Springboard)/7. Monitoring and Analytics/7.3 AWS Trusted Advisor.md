AWS Trusted Advisor is a automated web service that evaluate you resources against five pillars,
	1. Cost optimization
	2. Performance
	3. Security
	4. Fault tolerance
	5. Service limits
- Trusted Advisor in real time runs through a series of checks for each pillar in your account based on AWS best practices and it shows the details in the AWS console. 
	Some checks are free and others are depending on the level of your support plan.

Ex: 
1. If you haven't turned on the multifactor authentication for the root user.
2. If you have underutilized EC2 instance that might be able to be turned off in order to save money.
3. If you have EBS volumes that haven't been backed up in a reasonable amount of time.

- You can set up email alerts, that go out to billing, operations and security contacts as checks get run in your account. 

### Trusted Advisor Dashboard

	1. Green checks - no problems.
	2. Orange triangles - Recommended investigations.
	3. Red circles - Recommended actions.
