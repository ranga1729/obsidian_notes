# What is Cloud computing ?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go.

# What is Client-server model ?
In computing, a client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts to make requests to servers. 
A server can be a service such a s a Amazon Elastic Compute (EC2) type of a virtual machine. 

Ex: A client makes requests for a news articles or cat videos, the server evaluates the details of this request and fulfill it by returning the information to the client. 

# Deployment models for cloud computing
when selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as required application components, preferred resources management tools and any It information requirements and any legacy IT infrastructure requirements. 
Main three cloud computing models are, 
	1. Cloud-Based
	2. On-premises
	3. Hybrid

# 1. Cloud-Based
In a cloud deployment model you can,
	1. Run all parts of the applications on the cloud.
	2. Migrate existing application to the cloud.
	3. Design and built new application on the cloud. 

You can build your applications on low-level infrastructures that requires your It staff to manage or Alternatively you can build them using higher-level services that reduces the management, architecture of the core infrastructure. 

# 2. On-Premises deployment
## (Private cloud deployment)

In this model,
	1. Deploy resources by using virtualization technology and resource management tools.
	2. Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technology.

# 3. Hybrid deployment
In this model,
	1. Connect cloud based resources to on premises infrastructure.
	2. Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

Ex: 
A company have a legacy applications that are better to maintained on-premises.
Or 
government regulations require your business to keep certain records on-premises.

# Benefits of Cloud Computing
## 1. Trade upfront expenses for variable expenses
Upfront expenses refers to data centers, physical servers and other resources that you would need to invest in before using them.
Variable expenses means you only pay for computing resources you consume instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you are going to use them.

## 2. Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers.

## 3. Stop guessing capacity.
You don't have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application. 

Ex: Launching a Amazon EC2 instance and pay only for the compute time you use.

## 4. Benefits of massive economy of scale.
By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost because usage of hundreds of thousands of customers can aggregate in the cloud providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale.
This economy of scale translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices.

## 5. Increase speed and Agility
When computing in a datacenter it may take weeks to obtain new resources that you need. By comparison to the cloud computing enables you to access new resources within minutes and few clicks.

## 6. Go global in minutes.
The global footprint of the AWS cloud enables you to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency.
