This is the normal way to define a function,
```js
function add(x,y){
	return x+y;
}
```
#### Function Expression 
There is another way of define a function using a variable.
```js
const add = function(x, y){
	return x+y;
}
add(1,2); //3
```
- This function hasn't a name.
- This function is called using this variable name.
This both ways are working exactly the same way.
In this way, functions are values(or objects) in JavaScript. We can store them, pass them around.
Using this method, we can pass functions as an argument, we can return functions as the return value.

#### Higher order functions
Functions that operate on/with other functions.
They can,
1. Accept other functions as arguments.
2.  Return a function

**1. Accept other functions as arguments.**
Ex:
```js
function callTwice(func){
	func();
	func();
}
function rollDie(){
	const roll= Math.floor(Math.random()*6)+1;
	console.log(roll);
}
callTwice(rollDie);
```

**2. Returning a function**
```js
function makeMysteryFunc(){
	const rand = Math.random();
	if (rand > 0.5){
		reutrn function(){
			console.log("It's more than 0.5");
		}
	}
	else{
		return function(){
			alert("It's less than 0.5");
		}
	}
}
//we can capture the returning function using a variable
const mystery = makeMysteryFunc();
mystery();
```

#### Methods
We can add functions as properties on objects. They as identified as methods. we access is using the dot operator.
(Every method is a function, but not every function is a method.)

We can add a function as a property value.
Ex:
```js
const myMath = {
	PI : 3.14159
	multiply : function(x, y){
		return x*y;
	},
	divide : function(x, y){
		return x/y;
	},
	square : function(x){
		return x*x;
	}
}

myMath.square(2); //4
```
This is how 'Math' object is formed.
	![[Pasted image 20240515134600.png]]
- Instead of using dot operator we can use `myMath["square"](2)`
#### 'this' keyword
Used to access other properties on the same object.
Ex:
```js
const person ={
	first: 'Robert',
	last: 'Herjavec',
	fullName() {
		return '${this.first} ${this.last}'
	}
}

```

- Every function we write will be added to the 'window' object.
- Window is the top level object in JavaScript.
Ex:
```js
function add(x, y){
	return x+y;
}
```
When ever we invoke `add()` method it's invoking `windows.add()`. Because every global function is added to the window object.
#### try/catch
Used to catch errors or exceptions to avoid it from propagating outwards and crashing everything. 
Ex:
```js
hello.toUpperCase();
```
- `hello` isn't declared yet. This shows an error.
	![[Pasted image 20240515213722.png]]
	"**Uncaught ReferenceError**"
	This breaks the program.
To catch this error we use try/catch block.
```js
try{
	hello.toUpperCase();
} catch{
	console.log("ERROR!!!");
}
```
- This will not break the program and output the 'ERROR!!!.'

Ex:
```js
function yell(msg){
	try{
		console.log(msg.toUpperCase().repeat(3));
	} catch(e){
		console.log("Please pass a string next time!");
	}
}
```
- In case user forgot to provide a parameter to the yell method, that exception will be caught by this try/catch block.
