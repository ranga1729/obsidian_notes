### Function Scope
Variable Scope = Variable Visibility
The location where a variable is defined dictates where we have access to that variable. 
Ex:
```js
function helpMe(){
	let msg = "I'm on fire!";
	msg; //I'm on fire!
}
msg; //NOT DEFINED
```

Ex:
```js
let bird = 'Scarlet Macaw';
function birdWatch(){
	let bird = "Great Blue Heron";
	console.log(bird); //"Great Blue Heron"
}
birdWatch();
console.log(bird); //Scarlet Macaw
```
- Here, the `bird` variable inside of the function will mask the global variable. So, the `console.log(bird)` will print "Great Blue Heron" because now it is referencing to the local variable. 
- The outer `console.log(bird)` will print "Scarlet Macaw" since it's referencing to the global variable and

### Block Scope
`{}` defines a block except for a function. 
Block are including conditional statements and loops. 

Ex:
```js
for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
	let msg = "Help me!";
	console.log(msg); //"Help me!"
} 
console.log(msg); //error
```
If you are declaring variable using `let` keyword within a block scope, the scope will be set to that block where the variable is declared in.

**But if you declare variables using the `var` keyword, the scope of the variable will be set to the function.** 
Ex:
```js
for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
	let msg = "Help me!";
	console.log(msg); //"Help me!"
} 
console.log(msg); //"Help me!"
console.log(i); //'i' also accessible here.
```
This is the main reason why `let` and `const` keywords are introduced in JS, to add in variables that follows these scoping rules.
