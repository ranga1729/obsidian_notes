#### Primitive data Types of JS
1. Number
2. Boolean
3. String
4. Null
5. Undefined

- JavaScript console(developer console) repeat back the output to you when you run a JS code. This is known as REPL.
	![[Pasted image 20240407095151.png]]
	R - Read
	E - Evaluate
	P - Print
	L - Loop

### 1. Numbers
![[Pasted image 20240407100106.png]]
Includes,
	Positive numbers
	Negative numbers
	Whole numbers(integers)
	Decimal numbers

#### NaN (Not a Number)
NaN is a numeric value that represents something that is not a number. 
![[Pasted image 20240407103714.png]]
	In math, 0/0 is meaningless. In JS, that meaningless operations considered as a NaN.

- **typeof()** operator used to find out a

- JS apply BODMAS method or evaluate the order of operations. 

#### Variables
![[Pasted image 20240407113704.png]]
Variables in JS are like labels for values. we can,
	refer back to it.
	Use that value to so operations
	change it later. 

Basic syntax of creating a variable in JS,
```js
let someName = value;
```
Ex: 
```js
let year = 1985;
```

JavaScript is loosely type language, meaning we don't have to mention the type of the data we are going to assign to a variable in the declaration.
The type of the variable is determined by the currently assigned data to that variable.
We can assign other types of data into same variable. 
Ex:
```js
let varribale = 7;
typeof(varribale) //number
let variable = "seven";
typeof(varribale) //string
let varribale = true;
typeof(varribale) //boolen
```

#### CONST
![[Pasted image 20240407213035.png]]
**const** works just like **let**, except you can not change the value. 
We can use it to store thing that we know won't change
Ex:
```js
const pi = 3.14159;
const daysInWeek = 7;
```

#### VAR
This is the old variable keyword used for creating variables before 'let' and 'const' introduced in modern JS versions. It still working. 
It's recommended to use **let** and **const**.

### 2. Booleans
![[Pasted image 20240413124942.png]]
Booleans are true/false values. 

#### Variable Naming Conventions
1. Case sensitive
2. Can contain,
	- Unicode letters
	- Dollar sign( $ )
	- Underscore( _ )
	- digits( 0-9 )
3. It should not start with a digit. 

### 3. Strings
![[Pasted image 20240413180700.png]]
"String of characters"
Strings represent text and must be wrapped in quotes. 
It's fine to use wither single of double quotes, just be consistent in your codebase. 
If you need to use quotation marks inside of your text, use single and double quotation combination properly. 
Ex:
```js
let text1 = 'She said "Yes!" to him.'
```

Strings are indexed and each character has a corresponding index(a positional number). 
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240413181622.png]]We can access individual characters using these indexes. 
Ex:
```js
let animal = "Chicken";
console.log(animal[0]); //C
console.log(animal[1]); //h
console.log(animal[2]); //i
```
When you try to access a index out of the range of the string, it will give an "undefined" value.
Ex:
```js
console.log(animal[99]); //undefined
```
- Every string has a property called "length" indicating how many characters are in that string. 
Ex:
```js
let len = animal.length;
console.log(len); //7
```
- String can be concatenate. 
Ex:
```js
let fName = "John";
let lName = "Doe";
let fullName = fName + " " + lName;
console.log(fullName); //John Doe
```
- Unlike arrays, You can't update a one or serval characters of a string manually. But you can overwrite it completely. 
#### String Methods
String methods are built-in actions we can perform with individual strings. 
Ex: 
1. Searching within a string.
2. Replacing part of a string.
3. Changing the casing of a string.
Syntax
```js
string.method();
```

Ex: 
```js
let msg = 'I am king';
let capMsg = msg.toUpperCase(); //'I AM KING'
```
This is a non-destructive method. It doesn't change the original. To capture the changed version, you need to declare a variable for it. 

Ex: Trim() - remove all additional whitespaces in the string.
```js
let greeting = '   leave me alone plz     ';
greeting.trim(); //'leave me alone plz'
```
This is also a non-destructive method. 

- We can chain methods.
Ex:
```js
let grreting = "   Hello again!!!!";
let chained = greeting.trim().toUpperCase();
console.log(chained); //"HELLO AGAIN!!!!"
```

- Some methods require arguments that modify their behavior.
Syntax,
```js
string.method(arg)
```

Ex: indexOf() - giving the index of a given argument within the string. If the argument is not in the string, -1 returned. 
```js
let tvShow = 'catdog';
tvShow.indexOf('cat'); //0
tvShow.indexOf('dog'); //3
tvShow.indexOf('z'); //-1 (not found)
```
