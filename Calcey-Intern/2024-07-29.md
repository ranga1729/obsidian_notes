### SCRUM
DONE
On Friday,
-  Converted the LINQ query of the meal ratings task using query syntax. Nuwan told me to do the same query using navigation properties. 
- Learned about Navigation properties used in the Entity Framework and learned about client side evaluation.
- but there are still some doubts I need to clear about how to join tables using navigation properties instead of traditional join clause. So I need to clear those doubts and complete the task. 
- Nuwan gave me another sample task to do in the custom portal of the FFF. 
- Then I will move on to that.
