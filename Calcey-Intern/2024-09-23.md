In last Friday,
I went through the code of the customer portal's orderManagementView to get an idea about how the "pausedOrderForm" and "cancelOrderForm" is working.
And also I went through Admin portal's "OrderList" to get an idea about how the "Impersonation" is working.

TODAY
- will have a huddle with Nuwan.
- Need to look into merge conflicts in the meal-feedback pagination error's fix.
- continue the task of cancelling paused orders in the customer portal.
