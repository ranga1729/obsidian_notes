Did some changes to the order-form task based on Nuwan's feedbacks. Mainly about the promotional user flow, PubSub model's validation channels, the custom hook implemented to do the scroll up function and the place Order button.

Almost Complete the task to implement an eye icon in the 
customer portal's Account log's select orders table.
