## Synchronous Functions - Call Stack

When execute a function in JavaScript, it looks like this,
```js
function f1()
{
	//1st line
	//2nd line
	//3rd line
	//...
	//so on...
}
f1();
```
by default every line in a function executes sequentially, one line at a time. The same is applicable when you invoke multiple functions in your code.  
#### How the Function Execution Stack Works in Synchronous functions,
The JavaScript engine maintains a `stack` data structure called `function execution stack` or known as the `Call stack`. The purpose of the stack is to track the current function in execution. It does the following :
1. When the JavaScript engine invokes a function, it adds it to the stack, and the execution starts.
2. If the currently executed function calls another function, the engine adds the second function to the stack and starts executing it.
3. Once it finishes executing the second function, the engine takes it out from the stack.
4. The control goes back to resume the execution of the first function from the point it left it last time.
5. Once the execution of the first function is over, the engine takes it out of the stack.
6. Continue the same way until there is nothing to put into the stack.

Ex:
```js
function f1(){
	//code
}
function f2(){
	//code
}
function f3(){
	//code
}
//invoke the functions one by one
f1();
f2();
f3();
```
	![[first-flow.gif]]
	First, `f1()` goes into the stack, executes, and pops out. 
	Then `f2()` does the same, and finally `f3()`. 
	After that, the stack is empty, with nothing else to execute.

Ex:
```js
function f1(){
	//code
}
function f2(){
	f1();
}
function f3(){
	f2();
}
f3();
```
	![[second-flow.gif]]
	First `f3()` gets into the stack, invoking another function, `f2()`. 
	So now `f2()` gets inside of the call stack while `f3()` remains in the stack. The `f2()` function invokes `f1()`. 
	Then `f1()` to go inside the stack with both `f2()` and `f3()` remaining inside.

> [!NOTE] Summary
> Everything that happens inside the `function execution stack`(Call stack) is sequential. This is the `Synchronous` part of JavaScript. JavaScript's `main` thread makes sure that it takes care of everything in the stack before it starts looking into anything `elsewhere`.

## Asynchronous JavaScript
(Browser APIs and promises)
Asynchronous means "not occurring at the same time."

Executing things in sequence works well.
But in some cases, we do not anticipate occurring something(functions) 'NOW.'
	Ex:  fetch data from the server, execute functions with a delay
In this type of cases you want the code to execute `asynchronously`.

In these circumstances, you may not want the JavaScript engine to halt the execution of the other sequential code. So, the JavaScript engine needs to manage things a bit more efficiently in this case.

We can classify most asynchronous JavaScript operations with two primary triggers:
1. **Browser API/Web API** events or functions.
	These include methods like `setTimeout`, or event handlers like click, mouse over, scroll, and many more.
2. **Promises**
	A unique JavaScript object that allows us to perform asynchronous operations.

### Handle Browser APIs/Web APIs
Browser APIs like `setTimeout` and event handlers rely on `callback` functions. A callback function executes when an asynchronous operation completes.
```js
function printMe() {
  console.log('print me');
}
setTimeout(printMe, 2000);
```
- `SetTimeout` executes a function after a certain amount of time(milli seconds) has elapsed.

```js
function printMe() {
  console.log('print me');
}
function test() {
  console.log('test');
}
setTimeout(printMe, 2000);
test();
```
- When this code executes, `test()` will executes first because `printMe` function delays for 2 seconds.
output
	test
	printMe

****
### JavaScript Callback Queue (Task Queue)
avaScript maintains a queue of callback functions. It is called a callback queue or task queue. A queue data structure is `First-In-First-Out(FIFO)`. So, the callback function that first gets into the queue has the opportunity to go out first.

![[Pasted image 20240703145713.png]]
	The above image shows the regular `call stack`. 
	There are two additional sections to track if a browser API (like setTimeout) executes and queues the callback function from that API.

The JavaScript engine keeps executing the functions in the call stack. As it doesn't put the callback function straight into the stack, there is no question of any code waiting for/blocking execution in the stack. 

The engine creates a `loop` to look into the queue periodically to find what it needs to pull from there. It pulls a callback function from the queue to the call stack when the stack is empty. Now the callback function executes generally as any other function in the stack. The loop continues. This loop is famously known as the `Event Loop`.

Summary,
- When a Browser API occurs, park the callback functions in a queue.
- Keep executing code as usual in the stack.
- The event loop checks if there is a callback function in the queue.
- If so, pull the callback function from the queue to the stack and execute.
- Continue the loop.

Ex:
```js
function f1() {
    console.log('f1');
}
function f2() {
    console.log('f2');
}
function main() {
    console.log('main');  
    setTimeout(f1, 0); 
    f2();
}
main();
```
The code executes a `setTimeout` function with a callback function `f1()`. Note that we have given zero delays to it. This means that we expect the function `f1()` to execute immediately. Right after setTimeout, we execute another function, `f2()`.

Output,
	main
	f2
	f1

But, you may think that `f1` should print before `f2` as we do not delay f1 to execute. But no, that's not the case. Remember the `event loop` mechanism we discussed above? Now, let's see it in a step-by-step flow for the above code.
![[third-flow.gif]]
1. The `main()` function gets inside the call stack.
2. It has a console log to print the word main. The `console.log('main')` executes and goes out of the stack.
3. The setTimeout browser API takes place.
4. The callback function puts it into the callback queue.
5. In the stack, execution occurs as usual, so `f2()` gets into the stack. The console log of `f2()` executes. Both go out of the stack.
6. The `main()` also pops out of the stack.
7. The event loop recognizes that the call stack is empty, and there is a callback function in the queue.
8. The callback function `f1()` then goes into the stack. Execution starts. The console log executes, and `f1()` also comes out of the stack.
9. At this point, nothing else is in the stack and queue to execute further.

This is how `asynchronous` works. But not all.

#### Engine Handles Promises 
Promises are special objects that help you perform asynchronous operations.

You can create a promise using the `Promise` constructor. You need to pass an `executor` function to it. In the executor function, you define what you want to do when a promise returns successfully or when it throws an error. You can do that by calling the `resolve` and `reject` methods, respectively.
```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
        resolve('I am a resolved promise');
);
```
After the promise is executed, we can handle the result using the `.then()` method and any errors with the `.catch()` method.
```js
promise.then(result => console.log(result))
```
You use promises every time you use the `fetch()` method to get some data from a store.

JavaScript engine doesn't use the same `callback queue` we have seen earlier for browser APIs. It uses another special queue called the `Job Queue`.
### Job Queue
Every time a promise occurs in the code, **the executor function gets into the job queue**. The event loop works, as usual, to look into the queues but gives priority to the `job queue` items over the `callback queue` items when the `stack` is free.

The item in the callback queue is called a `macro task`, whereas the item in the job queue is called a `micro task`.

The entire flow goes like this,
- For each loop of the `event loop`, one task is completed out of the `callback queue`.
- Once that task is complete, the event loop visits the `job queue`. It completes all the `micro tasks` in the job queue before it looks into the next thing.
- If both the queues got entries at the same point in time, the `job queue` gets preference over the `callback queue`.

Ex:
```js
function f1() {
    console.log('f1');
}
function f2() {
    console.log('f2');
}
function main() {
    console.log('main');   
    setTimeout(f1, 0);
    new Promise((resolve, reject) =>
        resolve('I am a promise')
    ).then(resolve => console.log(resolve))
    f2();
}
main();
```
	![[fourth-flow.gif]]

Output
	main
	f2
	I am a promise
	f1

The flow is almost the same as above, but it is crucial to notice how the items from the job queue prioritize the items from the task queue. Also note that it doesn't even matter if the `setTimeout` has zero delay. It is always about the job queue that comes before the callback queue.

****
#### Summary
- The JavaScript engine uses the stack data structure to keep track of currently executed functions. The stack is called the function execution stack.
- The function execution stack (aka call stack) executes the functions sequentially, line-by-line, one-by-one.
- The browser/web APIs use callback functions to complete the tasks when an asynchronous operation/delay is done. The callback function is placed in the callback queue.
- The promise executor functions are placed in the job queue.
- For each loop of the event loop, one macro task is completed out of the callback queue.
- Once that task is complete, the event loop visits the job queue. It completes all the micro-tasks in the job queue before it looks for the next thing.
- If both the queues get entries at the same point in time, the job queue gets preference over the callback queue.
