An click event is an interaction when a user click on a specific element. We can respond to clicks by passing a callback to the `onClick` handler. 

HTML elements have an `onClick` event handler. 
Ex:

- In the callback function there's no parentheses are used. 
	`onClick={handleClick}` not `onClick={handleClick()}`
- If you've used parentheses in callback function, it will execute at the beginning without even clicking on it. 
But what if we want a callback function with parameters, we have to use parentheses.

To avoid this from happening, use an arrow function or a function expression in callback function.

#### Event Parameter
Event parameter is an object which describes the event that occurred. 
Normally use `e` or `event` to name the event parameter.

- This event parameter object has all the properties and methods related to that event. 
	Ex: clicked location, clicked element, timestamp...etc

We can utilizing these properties by accessing them through the event parameter.

Ex:

- When you click on this button, It's text content will be changed to "Ouch!"
