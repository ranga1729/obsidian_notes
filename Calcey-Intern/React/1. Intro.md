React is a JavaScript library, not a framework. React focuses on building a web application using **components**. 
	A component is a self-contained section of code that functions as a reusable building block.

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript known as **JSX**(JavaScript XML).
JSX allows you to write HTML like code within JavaScript files. 

React also utilizes a *virtual DOM*, a lightweight version of the real DOM of a webpage. We can keep track of any changes made to the virtual DOM and only apply that specific changes to the real DOM without needing to to refresh the entire webpage. 
This reduces rendering performance overhead.

#### Vite
Vite is a build tool designed to significantly enhance the development experience for react projects. It prioritizes speed and efficiency, offering a compelling alternative to the popular "create-react-app"(CRA).

"create-react-app"(CRA) is a popular tool created and maintained by Facebook that simplifies the process of setting up a new React project. I offers a streamlined approach that gets you coding quickly without needing to worry about complex build configurations. 

Steps,
1. Create a folder.
2. Create a Vite environment. 
	`npm create vite@latest`
	Then give a name for the project. (Ex: my-react-app)
	Select a framework.
	Select a language.
3. Change the directory to the project folder. 
	`cd my-react-app`
4. Install npm packages. 
	`npm install`
5. Run the dev environment.
	`npm run dev`

- `node_modules` folder contains external libraries and packages that our project relies on. 
- `public` folder contains any public assets. They are not bundled during the final output. 
	Ex: public fonts, images, videos
- `src` folder.

	- `assets` folder contain images and videos. similar to the `public` folder. But `assests` folder is bundled during the final output. 
	- `main.jsx` : main JavaScript file.

		React works with components. In here we are adding a single component, "<App/>" component. That component was added from `App.jsx`.
	-  `App.jsx` : contains root component

	- `App.css` : Stylesheet for `App.jsx`
	- `index.css` : Stylesheet for `main.jsx`
- `index.html` : main entry point into our program. 
	![[Pasted image 20240521173348.png]]
- `package.json` : Contains metadata about our project.

****
- React projects build on components. We already have an component called `App.jsx`. That component was imported to `main.jsx`, which is a the main JSX file. 
- Components can have dedicated stylesheets. 
	Ex: `App.css` is the stylesheet of `App.jsx` component.
