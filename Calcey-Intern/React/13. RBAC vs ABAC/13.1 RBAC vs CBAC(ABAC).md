RBAC = Role Based Access Control
![[Pasted image 20240704153032.png]]
### RBAC(Basic Concept)
Role-Based Access Control(RBAC) is a security approach that manages access to resources **based on a user's role** within an organization. 
The foundation of RBAC is defining roles.

- **Role** : Represent a specific set of responsibilities within an organization. 
	Ex: Doctor, Nurse, Lab Technician, Accountant
- **Permission** : Each role has assigned permission to it, which are specific actions a user can perform within the system. 
	Ex:
	Doctor : Write orders, Read orders, Read lab reports
	Nurse : Read orders, Read lab reports
	Lab Technician : Write lab reports
	Accountant : Read and Write financial data

*Individual users are assigned one or more roles based on their job duties.* This simplifies administration compared to assign permission directly to users.

### Further more
The following elements are necessary for the RBAC to be established.
- **User** : The access user.
- **Object(OBS)** : The object to be accessed.
- **Operations(OPS)** : The operations on an object to be accessed.
- **Permission** : Permission to operate on a target, expressed as a combination of OBS and OPS.
- **Role** : A many-to-many relationship between one or more grouped Permissions that have some meaning in the system.
	Ex: A doctor have multiple permissions, a single permission can be assigned to multiple roles.
	(An user that is assigned to a role is authorized to have those Permissions.)
- **User Assignment(UA)** : The mapping information of the User assigned to the Role.
- **Permission Assignment(UA)**: The mapping information of the Permission assigned to the Role.

The relationship between the elements is shown as an ER diagram.

User : Role = many : many
	A user can be assigned to multiple roles.
	A role can be assigned to multiple users.
Role : Permission = many : many
	A role can have multiple permissions.
	A permission can be associated with multiple roles.

(Post is not the HTTP post method here. It's an article in a content management system)
1. Implement required operations(methods)(OPS) in advance for the system resources to be used,
	Implement "Browse"(OPS) for the post browsing function. 
	Implement "Update"(OPS) for the post update function.
2. Set permissions
	View(OPS) of Post No.123(OBS)
	Update(OPS) on Post No.456(OBS)
3. Assign permission to roles
	Role 1 : Retain authority = Authority 1, Authority 2
	Role 2 : Retain authority = Authority 2
	Role 3 : Retain authority = Authority 2
In this example, authority is like a group of permissions.
	Authority 1 = Permission 1 + Permission 2
*Role 1 has a higher authority than role 2 and role 3.*
> [!NOTE] Authority (not much important)
> The permissions assigned to roles should reflect the *level of authority* needed to perform those tasks. A manager might have permission to approve financial transactions, which requires a **higher level of authority** than a customer service rep creating a support ticket.
> It's important to note that RBAC focuses on defining clear roles and permissions. **The concept of authority is implicit within the roles and how they are structured.**
4. Prepare user by assigning them roles.
	User 1 : Role 1
	User 2 : Role 2, Role 3

****
When a user accesses a secure system resource, the Permission, expressed as a combination of the specified Operation and the specified Object, is used to determine whether the roles associated with the access user are allowed.

User 1 view post No.123
	Role 1, held by User 1, holds Permission 1
User 1 updates post No.456
	 Role 1, held by User 1, holds Permission 2
User 2 view post No.456
	 Role 2 & Role 3, held by User 2, retain Permission 2

![[Pasted image 20240704141549.png]]
User 1 views post No.456
	Role 1, held by User 1, has no permission to view post No.456. 
	Only has access to view post No.123.
User 2 views post No.456
	Role 2 or Role 3, held by User 2, has no permission to view post No.456. 
	Only has access to update post No.456.

#### Advantages of RBAC
- **Improved Security:** By limiting access based on roles, sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users.
- **Easier Management:** Adding or removing users becomes simpler - just adjust their role assignments.
- **Compliance:** RBAC helps organizations meet security regulations by ensuring users have the minimum access required for their jobs.
#### Disadvantages of RBAC
- **Complexity for Granular Needs:** RBAC might be cumbersome for situations requiring very specific access controls beyond predefined roles.
- **Role Proliferation:** Creating too many roles can defeat the purpose of simplified management.
