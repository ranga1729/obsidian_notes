CBAS/ABAC = Claim Based Access Control / Attribute Based Access Control 
> [!NOTE] CBAC & ABAC is same ?
> CBAC is a Microsoft-specific way of talking about ABAC. When you see either term used, it generally refers to the same core concept of using attributes to control access.

Attribute-Based Access control(ABAC) makes access control decision based on a variety of attributes instead of predefined roles. 
The core of ABAC is attributes, which are characteristics of various aspects involved in an access request, mainly including subject, resource, action and environment attributes.
By considering these four elements, and ABAC policy can reach the Boolean decision, thus allowing or denying access. 

There are four types of attributes that the ABAC model utilizes to craft access policies. An ABAC policy can use one or all of them together, depending on the context and the policy requirements:
1. **Subject Attributes** : Refers to the user or entity which request access and  encompass user-related characteristics.
	Ex: roles, departments, security clearances
1. **Resource Attributes** : Encompass attributes relates to the assets or objects(files, applications, APIs,...) being accessed.
	Ex: file type, sensitivity level, ownership
3. **Action Attributes** : Defines the nature of users interaction with a resource.
	Ex: Read, Write, Delete, Update, frequency(how many times an action can be performed)
4. **Environment Attributes** : Capture the broader context of the access request, including time, location, and device used.
	Ex: time of the day, location of access, device information

##### Policies
ABAC defines access control policies based on above attributes. These policies use Boolean logic to determine if access should be granted. 
	Ex: a policy might say "grant read access to financial data only to employees in the finance department during business hours from their office location."
##### Authorization Engine
An ABAC system uses a policy authorization engine to evaluate access requests against the defined policies. The engine considers all relevant attributes and grants access only if all conditions in the matching policy are met.

ABAC offers several advantages:
- **Granular Control:** ABAC allows for highly specific access permissions based on various factors, making it suitable for complex environments.
- **Dynamic Access:** Access decisions can be adapted to changing conditions based on attribute values.
- **Reduced Role Management:** ABAC can eliminate the need for a large number of predefined roles.

However, there are also some drawbacks to ABAC:
- **Complexity:** Setting up and managing ABAC policies can be more complex than RBAC.
- **Performance Overhead:** Evaluating multiple attributes on every access request can impact system performance.


> [!NOTE] Analogy
> Imagine a bank vault. RBAC might give access to anyone with the "bank teller" role. ABAC would consider additional attributes - teller's ID, valid security clearance, working hours - before granting access to the vault.
