React is all about reusing components. 
A component is a small section of code that can include JavaScript and HTML.
Your function will return that code and make it reusable. 

#### Adding a class name to html elements
- In JSX, `class` is a reserved keyword. You can't use that to declare class in your HTML elements. Instead use `className` to declare a class in html elements. 

#### Adding Images to component
If you need to add images to bundle up and use them in your app, 
1. Save them in the `assests` folder in `src` folder. 
2. Then import the image from your component.(outside of the function)
	`import given_name from './location`
3. Use the given name to that file as the value for the `src` attribute of the html component.

#### Adding CSS
Three ways,
1. External
	 Add you CSS in the `index.css` file.
	 Great for global styles or small projects. 
1. Modules
2. Inline

**Modules,**
We can add CSS for each component. 
Normally we create a folder for each component and include JSX and CSS file there. 
In order to apply CSS style to the component, we must import the stylesheet to the component's JSX file. 
`import styles from 'location'`

Ex:

- In the `className` attribute we can specify what section of the stylesheet we need. (`styles.button`)

When passing a value `{}` are used to pass a dynamic value. 
Benefit of using modules is, when we pass the style and class name to the HTML element because react will generate a unique name for that dynamic value using a hashing algorithm.

For that reason, modules are better to avoid naming conflicts. 
- Global styles will be overridden by modules. 
- Ideal for individual components that have their own unique styles. 

**Inline,**
- Add your CSS styles within the JSX file.
- Create JavaScript object literal to include styles. 
- Make sure to use Camel Case for property names and include values within quotes. 
- Then use `style` attribute to specify the style in your HTML element.
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240525032535.png]]
Benefits,
- This method is convenient and easy to understand. 
- It prevents global style conflicts because we are no longer working with class names. 
- Ideal for isolated components with minimum stylings. 
	Ex: like buttons, subscribe button
Downsides,
- Reduce the readability of your component code. 
- Not great for complex stylings.
