- React UI is build upon components.
- Each components can have a separate CSS style sheet. 
- Components are in `.jsx` extension.(JavaScript XML)

- Within `Header.jsx` we need to  declare a function. Within that function we can include HTML elements and JS codes and CSS to return. Everything should be in that return method. 
- Return method can only return a one element. But elements can be nested. 
- At the end, export statement should be in place so we can import the component in another file.
- When you want to return multiple elements, you can use a "fragment" to include all them in it. It works like a container. (`<> .... </>`)

- We can add our react components using import statement. 
`import file_name from './location'`
