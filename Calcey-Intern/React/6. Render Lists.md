**When rendering a list, assign a `key` prop to each element within the list.**
React uses keys to efficiently update the DOM when the list changes. By assigning a key to each element, this process can be done efficiently. 
Ideal key values are unique identifiers from the data itself.
	Ex: IDs, unique strings
	If unique identifiers are unavailable, consider using the index of the item within the array as a last resort, but be aware of the potential performance implications for large lists. 
	If you pulling data from a database, each row of data is going to have unique ID.
