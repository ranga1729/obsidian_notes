Before react hooks were introduced, class components were the primary way to manage state and lifecycle methods in React. 
*React Hooks* introduced as a special function that allows components to use React features without writing class components. (Introduced in React V16.8)
	Ex: useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useCallback and etc... 
(is a function begins with a 'use', it's probably a react hook)

**useState** is a react hook that allows the creation of a stateful variable AND a setter function to update its value in the virtual DOM. Basically, it provides a way to add data or properties that need to be tracked and dynamically change within your component. 

Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240526102753.png]]
- This component will output counter. Initial value is set to 0. When we hit the button, count will be incremented. 

Output before clicking :
![[Pasted image 20240526102854.png]]

Output after clicking :
![[Pasted image 20240526102838.png]]

##### Key points,
1. In order to use `useState` you first import it from the `react` library.
	`import React, {useState} from 'react'`
2. `useState` function returns an array with two elements
	1. Stateful variable/State variable (ex: count)
	2. Setter function (ex: setCount)
```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```
- Naming convention for the setter function is to type 'set' then the variable name.
- You can pass a initial value as an argument to the useState. (ex: 0)
3. Whenever we want to change the value for the stateful variable, we must do it using the setter function. 
	`count++` or `count = count+1` is not gonna work.
	Instead use `setCount(count+1)`
