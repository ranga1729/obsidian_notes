Props = Properties
Props are read only properties that are shares between components. A parent components can send data to a child component.
When you include a component within a parent you can send that child component key-value pairs. 
	`<component key1=value1 key2=value2 .../>`
Basically, props are arguments passed into React components. Within the component, you can access these data using dot `.` operator. 

Key points,
- Props are read-only within a component. They cannot be modified directly by the component itself.
- Props are passed down a component hierarchy, from parent to child.
- They can be of various data types like strings, numbers, Booleans, arrays, or even objects.

Ex:

- In order for this component to accept props, this function needs a `props` parameter.
	`props` is a JavaScript object. 
- `{props.isStudet ? "Yes" : "No"}` is a ternary operator. If `isStudent` is true it will print "Yes" else "No".

- In the `App.jsx`, `Student` component is the child. `App` is the parent. (A parent components can send data to a child component.)
- To send data to child element, we provide key-value pair in the `Student` component. 
- **If the data you are passing is not a string literal, You got to enclose them with curly braces.**

#### PropTypes
PropTypes is a mechanism that ensures that the passed values is of the correct datatype. 
Ex: `age:PropType.number`

- To use propTypes, you must import them from the node modules. 
- Then create a propType object specifying key's data type.

If we miss type our data types, an warning will be shown in our web browser's console. But it won't crash the app.

==Including propTypes is a best practice.== 

#### Default props
Providing default values for props in case they are not passed from the parent component. 
- To set default values, you must create a `defaultProps` object in the component.
