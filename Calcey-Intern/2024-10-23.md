Had a huddle with Nuwan to review the changes of order-form and that eye icon task. 
I have a issue with some asynchronous functions in the order-form need to do find a solution for that in order to complete the new approach of the scroll up function. 

I received some other suggestions too regarding the order form and also about the eye icon task in the customer portal. 
I'm currently working on the eye icon task. Have to implement the same task in the admin portals select tab as well. after I complete that eye icon thing I will move on to the order-form.
