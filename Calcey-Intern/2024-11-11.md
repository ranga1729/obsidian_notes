I completed the front end of the order history task. 
Created a separate component for the Senesh's design for the task.
And applied the changes to the admin portal's -> select orders -> tables as it required in the user story. 
there's a one thing I need to test in the backend, then I will put a PR and hand it over to Induni.

There are some merged PRs that I need to hand over to QA, today I will have huddle with Nusrath.
