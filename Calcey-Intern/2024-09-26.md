Yesterday, Nuwan was busy and I couldn't get him to a huddle to talk about the paused-orders task. 

So, I started to practice React and tried to create some components from the scratch by inspecting the Login Page of the FFF. 

Learned how libraries are used in and how the code is managed, component reusing.
