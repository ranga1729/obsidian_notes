### SCRUM
DONE
- did a small change to meal-rating task re-opened by QA. 
Regarding the order-form task,
- Refactored the code to scroll up to empty fields in the order form. now it's ok.
- I needed a way to let inner components know that next button has clicked to trigger their validations. 
- Updated the order-form store to keep track of the next button click. 
- created a custom hook to get next button status from inner components. 
- This kinda worked. But I still need to do some experiments to check whether it's working properly.

TODAY
- will continue to do rest of the task.
