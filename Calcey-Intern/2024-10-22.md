 I'm changing the scroll-up function of the order form tasks in a way it works on both empty fields and also on invalid fields.
I tested the new approach using the nutrition page of the order form and had do do some changes in the store and every inner component of the nutrition page and it seems working with some issues. 
Today I will do a code clean up for the most recent changes and then will apply the new approach of the scroll-up to other order form pages as well.

If I get the confirmed requirements of the eye icon task in the custom portal, I will parallelly work on that too.
