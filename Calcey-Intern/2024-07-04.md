### SCRUM
DONE
- Learned about the what's happening underneath the hood in synchronous functions and asynchronous functions in order to understand how promises are working. 
got an idea about the call stack, callback queue and job queue in JavaScript how those things orchestrate functions calls and API calls in JavaScript. 

But I couldn't use more time to understand role base authentication,  claim base authentication and react router yesterday.

TODAY
For today
- I need to complete role and claim authentications first.
- Then I will move on to the react router.
- After that I will continue to work on the front end task that Nuwan gave me.
