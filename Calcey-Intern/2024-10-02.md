Yesterday I worked on a  new task to implement a button in the table of the menu items of select tab, in a way that when user click on that view button user will navigate to the select meal-variations tab and will show all the variations created on that selected menu item.

Nuwan reviewed the task and then I created a merger request. 

Will work on another task today.
