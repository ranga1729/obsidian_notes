DONE
- cleaned up the order-form code bit. 
- Found that I have missed some parts in the order-form so applied the changes to them as well. 
- Now I faced another issue with the scroll up functionality in the 3rd page of the order-form. Today I need to find a solution for that. 

TODAY
- Yesterday I couldn't have a huddle with Nuwan, so Will have it today to get his feedback.
- Today will apply changes to the payment page of the order-form.
