DONE
Yesterday,
- Applied order-form task's required changes to the maternity status in the first page of the order-form. I've missed that section before but now it's working. 
- Previously I had problem with that scroll up function with components which do conditional rendering. Found a way to handle that issues also. 
- Apart from that I worked on the payment page of the order-form.

TODAY
- Will continue to do the task.
