Used when we have to make a copy/clone from an existing object. 
It's efficient when creating objects that are expensive(resource intensive) or complex to create or require complex initialization. 
##### Problem of cloning using a traditional method,
```java
public class Student
{
	string name;
	int age;
	private int rollNumber;

	public Student()
	{
	}

	public Student(string name, int age, int rollNumber)
	{
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
		this.rollNumber = rollNumber;
	}
}

public class Program
{
	public static void Main()
	{
		//creating the original object
		Student OrgObj = new Student("John Doe", 22, 2023377);
		
		//creating the clone object
		Student cloneObj = new Student();
		cloneObj.name = OrgObj.name;
		cloneObj.age = OrgObj.age;
		cloneObj = OrgObj.rollNumber;
	}
}
```
1. `rollNumber` is a private variable. It can only be accessed within the class. 
2. In this example, `Main()` function do the cloning. Not the object itself. 
	For an example, imagine a instance with 100 variables, clones should only get 98 of them. In this case, `Main()` has to know all the 100 variables and 98 of them only get copies to the clone. 

##### Solution
```java
public class Document : ICloneable
{
	public string Title { get; set; }
	public string Text { get; set; }
	public string Author { get; set; }
//constructor
	public Document(string title, string text, string author)
	{
		Title = title;
		Text = text;
		Author = author
	}
//clone method, implements from the ICloneable interface
	public Clone()
	{
		return new Document(Title, Text, Author); //shollow copy
	}
}

public class Program
{
	public static void Main(string[] args)
	{
	//create a prototype document
		Document prototypeDoc = new Document("Sample Title", "Sample Text", "Sample Author")
		
	//Clone the prototype to create a new doc
	var newDoc1 = (Document)protoTypeDoc.Clone();
	newDoc1.Title = "New Document 1";

	var newDoc2 = (Document)protoTypeDoc.Clone();
	newDoc1.Text = "New Text for the Document 2";
	}
}
```

##### Explanation
![[Pasted image 20240606110138.png]]
	Concrete Prototype : A class that implements the prototype interface.(or extends the abstract class)
	Client : The code or module that requests the creation of new objects by interacting with the prototype. It initiates the cloning process without being aware of the concrete classes involved. 

**Steps,**
1. We define a **Prototype Interface**(or an Abstract class) that specifies a cloning method. 
	It defines the common interface that concrete prototypes must implement, ensuring that all prototypes can be cloned in a consistent manner. 
2. Then we Implements the cloning logic (often a shallow copy) within the concrete classes that you want to be cloneable. 
	This method defines how the objects internal state should be duplicated to create a new independent instances.


> [!NOTE] ICloneable Interface in C#
> In C#, **ICloneable** interface includes only the **Clone()** method.
> It allows classes to define their own cloning behavior beyond the basic shallow copy provided by the "Object.MemberwiseClone()" method. 

##### Shallow Copy vs Deep copy
Shallow copy,
- Creates a new object of the same type as the original. 
- copies the values of the primitive types. 
- For reference data types, it simply copies the references themselves. Both the original and the clone now point to the same object in memory. 
Deep copy,
- Creates a completely new and independent object of the same type as the original.
- It copies both the primitive and reference data members. 
- For reference data members, it creates entirely new copies of the referenced objects, rather than just copying the references. This ensures that the original and the clone have independent copies of any nested objects.
