This is a class creation pattern.
This pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a single point of access to it throughout your application.

Ex:
	Database Connections. (If we need only one Database connection)

4 ways to achieve singleton,
1. Eager/Early initialization
2. Lazy initialization
3. Synchronized method
4. Double Locking(Commonly used)

> [!NOTE]
> Key points to considers,
> - **Private constructor** : to prevent object creation from outside the class.
> - **Static variable** : static variable holds the single instance of the class.
> - **Public static method** : provide access to the instance. 
##### 1. Eager/Early Initialization
```java
public class DBConnection
{
//creating the object
	private static DBConnection conObject = new DBConnection();
//constructor is private
	private DBConnection() {}
//public getter
	public static DBConnection getInstance()
	{
		return conObject;
	}
}

public class Program
{
	public static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		DBConnection connectionObject = DBConnection.getInstance();
	}
}
```
- `private static DBConnection conObject = new DBConnection();` will create an object when the class is loading.
	Since the object instantiation is `static`, the object is related to the class itself.
- Since the constructor is private, more objects can not be created afterwards. 
- The only created instance can be accessed through the `getInstance()` method. 

**Issue with eager/early initialization,**
	The class is always initialized whether it is being used or not. 

##### 2. Lazy Initialization
The class is initialized only when it is required. 
Better than eager/early initialization. 
```java
public class DBConnection
{
	
	private static DBConnection conObject;
	
	private DBConnection() {}
	
	public static DBConnection getInstance()
	{
		//the object get initialized only if the object is not initialized before.
		if(conObject == null)
		{
			conObject = new DBConnection();
		}
		return conObject;
	}
}
```
- Constructor is private to prevent additional objects get initialized outside the class.
- public static getter method is checking whether the object is null at every single time it invoked. If the object is null, it will initialize the object for the first time. After that it will only return the reference variable holding the object. 

**Issue with lazy initialization,**
	If there are multiple threads exist, invoking the `getInstance()` method by only one thread is enough to initialize one objects for each thread.

##### 3. Synchronized method
Synchronize method can handle the multiple threads issue in the lazy initialization.
```java
public class DBConnection
{
	
	private static DBConnection conObject;
	
	private DBConnection() {}
	
	synchronized public static DBConnection getInstance()
	{
		//the object get initialized only if the object is not initialized before.
		if(conObject == null)
		{
			conObject = new DBConnection();
		}
		return conObject;
	}
}
```
*Java uses `synchronize` keyword to achieve thread safety. C# uses `lock` keyword to do the same.*

**Issue with lazy initialization,**
	Since `lock` is a resource intensive method, it's better to use it lesser times. But in synchronize method, if 1000 request come to the `getInstance` method, lock method will be used used 1000 times. 
##### 3. Double Locking
In the double locking method, the `synchronize` or `lock` method will be used only if the object is not initialized before hand.
```java
public class DBConnection
{
	private static DBConnection conObject;
	
	private DBConnection() {}
	
	public static DBConnection getInstance()
	{//first check
		if(conObject == null)
		{
			synchronized (DBConnection.class)
			{//second check
				if(conObject == null)
				{
					conObject = new DBConnection();
				}
			}
		}
		return conObject;
	}
}
```
- `DBConnection` class get lock/synchronize only if the object object is null. (Thread safety)
