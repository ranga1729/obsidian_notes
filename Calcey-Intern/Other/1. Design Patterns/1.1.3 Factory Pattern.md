Creational design pattern. 
It is used when all the object creation and it's business logic need to keep at one place.

Ex: Imagine we have 100 classes and we have implemented the object creational logic inside of those each relevant class. In this scenario, if we need to change something relates to object creation, we have to consider all of those classes and logics individually. 

Using a factory design pattern, we can include all of those logics and conditions related to object creation into a single class. In case we want to change something, we just need to focus on that specific class.

**Core concept,**
Factory pattern defines an interface or abstract class for creating object. Subclasses of the factory then implement the specific logic for creating different types of objects. 

**Structure,**
1. **Base Interface/Abstract class** : Defines the common interface or base class that all products(to be created) will adhere to. It specifies the methods that all products must implement. 
2. **Concrete product classes** : These classes implement the base interface and provide the actual functionality for specific types of objects.
3. **Factory Interface/Abstract Class** : (optional - okey to create the concrete factory class directly) This defines the interface or abstract class that specifies the creation method for products.
4. **Concrete Factory class** : Implements the logic for creating specific concrete objects. Typically use conditional statements or configuration setting to determine which to create. 
Ex:
```C#
//Base interface
public interface IShape
{
	void Draw();
}

//Concrete product classes
public class Circle : Ishape
{
	public void Draw()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Drawing a circle.")
	}
}
public class Square : IShape
{
	public void Draw()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Drwaing a square.")
	}
}

//shape factory class
public class ShapeFactory 
{ 
	public static IShape GetShape(string shapeType) 
	{ 
		switch (shapeType.ToLower()) 
		{ 
			case "circle": return new Circle(); 
			case "square": return new Square(); 
			default: throw new ArgumentException("Invalid shape type"); 
		} 
	} 
}

//client code
public class Program 
{ 
	public static void Main(string[] args) 
	{ 
		string shapeType = Console.ReadLine(); 
		//Get user input for shape type 
		IShape shape = ShapeFactory.GetShape(shapeType); 
		if (shape != null) 
		{ 
			shape.Draw(); 
		} 
	} 
}
```
