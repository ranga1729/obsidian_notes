A creational Design pattern.
It is used to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
This pattern is useful when an object needs to be created in multiple steps or when the creation process involves many optional parameters. 

#### Components,
1. **Product** : The complex object that is being build. 
2. **Builder** : An interface(or an abstract class) that defines the construction steps.
3. **ConcreteBuilders** : These classes that implements the builder interface and provide specific implementation for building different types of products. 
	Ex: HawaiianPizzaBuilder, SpicyPizzaBuilder
4. **Director** : (optional) Uses the builder interface to orchestrate the construction process in a specific order. It can be useful for creating complex configurations or variations of the product.

```C#
//The Product
public class Pizza
{
	private string dough;
	private string sauce;
	private List<string> toppings;

	public Pizza(string dough, string sauce, List<string> toppings)
	{
		this.dough = dough;
		this.sauce = sauce;
		this.toppings = toppings;
	}
	//define setters and getters for this class
}

//Builder interface
public interface PizzaBuilder
{
//return types are set to 'PizzaBuilder' to use method chaining.
	PizzaBuilder SetDough(string dough);
	PizzaBuilder SetSauce(string sauce);
	PizzaBuilder AddTopping(string topping);
	Pizza GetPizza();
}

//Concrete builders
public class HawaiianPizzaBuilder : PizzaBuilder
{
	//private pizza object
	private Pizza pizza = new Pizza();

	public PizzaBuilder SetDough(string dough)
	{
		pizza.dough = dough;
		return this;
	}
	public PizzaBuilder SetSauce(string sauce)
	{
		pizza.sauce = sauce;
		return this;
	}
	public PizzaBuilder AddTopping(string topping)
	{
		pizza.toppings.Add("PineApple"); //since it's a hawaiian pizza.
		pizza.toppings.Add(topping); 
		//toppings is a List, used 'Add' method.
		return this; 
	}
	//public getter to get the pizza object
	public Pizza GetPizza()
	{
		return pizza;
	}
//by returning this each step as 'PizzaBuilder' type, we can chain all those methods together. 
}

//Director
public class PizzaDirector
{
	public Pizza MakeHawaiianPizza()
	{
		PizzaBuilder builder = new HawaiianPizzaBuilder();
		builder.SetDough("Thin Crust");
		builder.SetSauce("Tomato");
		builder.AddToppings("Pineapple");
		builder.AddToppings("Ham");
		return builder.GetPizza();
	}
}

//client code
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
	PizzaDirector director = new PizzaDirector();
	Pizza hawaiianPizza = director.MakeHawaiianPizza();

	Console.WriteLine(hawaiianPizza.dough); // Thin Crust
	Console.WriteLine(hawaiianPizza.sauce); // Tomato
	Console.WriteLine(hawaiianPizza.toppings[0]); // Pineapple
}
```

****
The purpose of the builder methods is to configure different aspects of the final object being built. They typically perform some internal logic related to setting that specific property and then **return the builder object itself**. This allows for method chaining.

```C#
public interface PizzaBuilder
{
  PizzaBuilder SetDough(string dough); // Returns PizzaBuilder
  PizzaBuilder SetSauce(string sauce); // Returns PizzaBuilder
  PizzaBuilder AddTopping(string topping); // Returns PizzaBuilder
  Pizza GetPizza(); // Returns the final Pizza object
}
```
By returning the builder itself, you can chain multiple builder method calls together like this:
```C#
PizzaDirector director = new PizzaDirector();
Pizza hawaiianPizza = director.MakeHawaiianPizza();

// This is achieved through method chaining 
Pizza hawaiianPizza = new HawaiianPizzaBuilder()
  .SetDough("Thin Crust")
  .SetSauce("Tomato")
  .AddTopping("Pineapple")
  .AddTopping("Ham")
  .GetPizza();

```
This chaining syntax makes the code more concise and easier to read, especially when configuring complex objects with multiple properties.
