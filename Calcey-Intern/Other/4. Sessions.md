Session refers to a way to store information(in variables) to be used across multiple pages of a web application. Sessions are crucial for
	maintaining user interactions,
	providing a seamless user experiences and 
	implementing features like user authentication, shopping carts and personalized contents. 

##### Key Characteristics,
1. Temporary Storage
	Session data is typically stored temporarily on the server. It persist only for duration for the user's interaction with website.(till browser is closed, user logs out or the session times out)
2. Unique Session ID 
	Each session is identified by a unique session ID, which is usually stored in the cookie in the browser. This ID is sent with each HTTP request to link the user to their session data. 
3. Server-Side Storage
	Unlike cookie, which store data on the client's machine, session store data on the server. This makes them more secure as sensitive information isn't exposed to the client. 
4. Data Persistent
	Session can persist across multiple page requests and are useful retaining information such as user login status, shopping cart content or form data between different pages.
#### How Session works ?
1. **Session Creation**
	When a user first visits a website, the server creates a new session and assigns a unique session ID to the user. This session ID is sent to the user's browser and stored as a cookie.
2. **Storing Data**
	As the user navigates the website, the server can store data associated with the session ID. This data is usually kept in a server-side storage mechanism like memory, database or a file.
3. **Accessing Data**
	On subsequent requests, the user's browser sends the session ID back to the server. The server uses this ID to retrieve and mange the session data, enabling personalized and stateful interactions. 
4. **Session Termination**
	Sessions can be terminated manually by the user(by logging out) or automatically by the server after a period of inactivity(session timeout).
