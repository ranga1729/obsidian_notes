Middleware refers to intermediary layer between different systems, applications or components, facilitating communication and data exchange.
Middleware can provide various services and functions, making it easer to develop and manage complex distributed system. 
#### Purpose
- Middleware helps integrate disparate systems and applications, allowing the  to work together. 
- It facilitates communication between different parts of a software system, often abstracting the complexities of network protocols, data formats and communication mechanism. 
- Middleware can provide essential services such as authentication, logging, message, queuing, transaction management and data transformation. 
#### Types of Middleware
- **Message-Oriented Middleware(MOM)** : Enables communication between distributed systems through message passing. 
	Ex: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka
- **Object Request Brokers(ORB)** : Facilitate communication between objects in a distributes environment. 
	Ex: COBRA
- **Database Middleware** : Provides a unified interface for database access, allowing applications to interact with different database in a consistent manner. 
- **Application Server Middleware** : Offers runtime environment and services for deploying and managing applications.
	Ex: WebLogic, JBoss
- **Web Middleware** : Facilitates web-based interactions, handling HTTP requests and responses. 
	Ex: Express.js, Node.js, Django middleware for python

#### Usage
- API Management : Manage and expose APIs, rate limiting, authentication and logging.
- Enterprise Application Integration(EAI) : Integrate enterprise systems and applications.
- Service-Oriented Architecture(SOA) : Provide infrastructure for building and deploying services. 

Ex: 
-  Express.js middleware : In Node.js applications, this middleware can process requests and responses, enabling features like JSON bodies, handling cookies, saving static files. 
- Django middleware : In a Django application, middleware components can perform tasks such as authentication, session management and request logging.
