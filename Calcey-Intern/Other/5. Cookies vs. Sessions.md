| Aspect                 | Cookies                                                                                                    | Sessions                                                                           |

| **Definition**         | A small piece of data stored on the client-side (browser) and sent to the server with each request.        | A way to store data on the server to maintain user state across multiple pages.    |
| **Storage Location**   | Client-side (browser)                                                                                      | Server-side                                                                        |
| **Data Capacity**      | Limited to about 4KB per cookie.                                                                           | Can store larger amounts of data (limited by server storage).                      |
| **Security**           | Less secure as data is stored on the client-side and can be accessed and modified by the user.             | More secure since data is stored on the server. Sensitive data is less exposed.    |
| **Lifetime**           | Can persist across sessions (based on expiration time set).                                                | Typically lasts until the user logs out, closes the browser, or session times out. |
| **Performance**        | Minimal impact on server performance as data is stored and managed by the client.                          | Can impact server performance due to storage and retrieval overhead.               |
| **Usage**              | Suitable for storing non-sensitive information like preferences, tracking data, and session identifiers.   | Ideal for storing sensitive information and maintaining user state.                |
| **Data Sharing**       | Can be shared across different servers within the same domain.                                             | Data is not automatically shared between different servers.                        |
| **Accessibility**      | Accessible by both the client (via JavaScript) and the server.                                             | Accessible only on the server-side.                                                |
| **Expiration Control** | Managed by setting an expiration date. Can be set to expire at a specific time or when the browser closes. | Managed by the server. Sessions typically expire after a period of inactivity.     |
| **Example**            | Storing user preferences, tracking user behavior, remembering login details.                               | Storing user authentication status, shopping cart contents.                        |
