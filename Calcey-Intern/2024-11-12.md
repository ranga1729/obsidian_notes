Yesterday I ran into another Issue in the order history API, anyway I fixed it today. Created to PR on that.
And as we discussed yesterday in slack, I added the "Discount code" in to the order history modal after fixing that issue.

Today I will have a huddle to get the Chomal's changes regarding tokens in to the order history branch and then i think i can finalize it.
