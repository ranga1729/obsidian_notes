### SCRUM
DONE
Regarding the order-form task,
- Custom hook to get the next button status is working as I expected. 
- There are 10 required fields on the first page of the order-form, Able to complete the task on 6 of them. 

- Rest is height, weight, birthday and gender inputs.
Reason is some of the components are bit complex than other components. So need to find a way to do those changes without affecting the general purpose of those components. 
Once the I figure out the way to do the changes in once components I can apply it to most of them i guess. Will see today. 

TODAY
- will working on the rest of the fields.
