### SCRUM
DONE
- I Tried to fix the bug that I faced during the task to implement the meal ratings download button.
- Had a KT with Nuwan.
- He gave me some leads about the error.
- Then I fixed the issue yesterday now it's working properly. 
- Nuwan told me to set the same LINQ query I used in the meal ratings task in different ways.

TODAY
- today I will do that. 
- Also Nuwan gave some new words to search and learn about C# that came across while we inspecting the error yesterday.
- After doing the query I need to look in to that as well.
