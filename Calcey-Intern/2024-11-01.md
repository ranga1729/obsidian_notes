Had a huddle with Nuwan to review the backend part of the select order history and the order form.

I'm currently doing some changes in the order history end point and almost done with it.
Then I will test the changes.

Did some changes to the scroll up function of the order-form. 
Now it's better than before but there are some issues that need to be debugged.
I will work on them after the order history task.

```C#
Credits = o.Transactions
    .Join(_dataContext.TransactionLines,
    t => t.Id,
    tl => tl.TransactionId,
    (t, tl) => new { t.OrderId, tl.LedgerCode, tl.LedgerCodeId, t.Amount })
    .Where(tl => tl.LedgerCode.Code == LedgerCodes.CustomerCredit)
    .Where(t => t.OrderId == o.Id)
    .GroupBy(tl => tl.LedgerCodeId)
    .Select(g => g.Sum(r => r.Amount)).FirstOrDefault(),
```
