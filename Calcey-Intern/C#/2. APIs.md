#### .NET Web API
.NET web API is a framework within ASP.NET used to create HTTP-based web services. 

Characteristics,
1. Adhere to REST(Representational State Transfer) architectural principles.
2. Communication between clients and .NET web API transpires entirely through HTTP requests and responses. 
3. Devs can leverage frameworks built-in features or extend it using plugins and custom middleware.
4. Use JSON to represent data objects and data serialization.
5. Client-agnostic.(As long as a client can send HTTP requests and interpret the responses, it can interact with the API regardless of its programming language or platform.)

#### REST APIs
![[Pasted image 20240529105621.png]]
REST is a communication standard over internet. It's used by most mobile and web application to talk to the server. 

REST is a set of rules for building web APIs.
1. Client-Server separation.
2. Stateless communication.
	Server doesn't store any context about the client between requests. 
3. Uniform interface
	Client interacts with the server through standardized interface that uses HTTP methods.(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
4. Cacheable
	Servers can be explicitly indicate whether responses can be cached by clients.
5. Layered Systems
	A RESTful system can be layered, with intermediaries like caches, load balancers and security gateways handling request before reaching the server. 
6. HATEOAS(Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) - optional
	Suggest that the server should provide information within the response about the available actions and resources the client can access next. 
7. Code on demand - Optional
	A server can send executable code(scripts) to the client to extend its functionality on the fly. 

- APIs that follows the REST standards called a RESTful API.
- A RESTful API organizes resources into a set of unique URIs(Uniform Resource Identifier).

- URIs differentiate different types of resources on a server. 
An API should group resources by nouns, not verbs.

- A client request for resource by making a request to the endpoint over HTTP. This request has a specific format.
```http
POST/products HTTP/1.1
```
- **POST** : HTTP verb. Indicates what we want to do with the resource. 
- **product** : resource

**HTTP Requests,**
1. POST : Create a resource
2. GET : Read a resource.
3. PUT : Update a resource.
4. DELTE : Delete an existing resource.
- This what CRUD stands for.

In a body of these requests, there could be an optional HTTP request body that contains a custom payload of data, usually encoded in JSON.

- Server receives the request, process it and formats the result into a response. The first line of the response contains the HTTP status code to tell client what happened to the request. (Ex: 200)
Types of HTTP status codes,
1. 200-level : Success
2. 400-level : Something wrong with out request.
3. 500-level : Something wrong at the server level.

- A well-behaved client could choose to retry a failed request with a 500-level status code. When an API is idempotent making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request.

	POST request is not idempotent as it creates a new resource.

- Response payload(JSON payload) is optional.
- Client and Sever doesn't required to store any information about each other. 
- Every request and response is independent from all others. 

**REST API versioning,**

Most used way to version a API is to prefix the version before the resource on the URI.
