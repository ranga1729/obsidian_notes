Loading related data from the database can be done using main strategies,
1. Eager loading
2. Lazy loading
3. Explicit loading
#### 1. Eager Loading
Process of loading related data along with the main entity in a single query.
Done by using the **Include** method. 
	Usage : To avoid multiple database queries when retrieving related data. 
```C#
using (var context = new BloggingContext())
{
    var blogs = context.Blogs
                       .Include(b => b.Posts)  // Eagerly loads related Posts
                       .ToList();
}
```
- when fetching blogs, the related posts are also loaded in the same query, reducing the number of database calls.
#### 2. Lazy Loading
Process of loading related entities on demand. EF will automatically load the related entities when they are accessed for the first time.
	**Usage :**  When related data might not always be needed and you want to defer loading it until necessary.
```C#
public class Blog
{
    public int BlogId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
	
    // Navigation property
    public virtual ICollection<Post> Posts { get; set; }
}

using (var context = new BloggingContext())
{
    var blog = context.Blogs.FirstOrDefault();
    var posts = blog.Posts;  // Related Posts are loaded here (lazy loading)
}
```
- The related posts are not loaded when the blog is initially fetched. Instead, they are loaded when the `Posts` property is accessed for the first time. 
- Used `virtual` keyword to enable lazy loading.

> [!NOTE] virtual Keyword
> Lazy loading requires proxies and works only when the navigation properties are marked as `virtual`. It also requires that the context instance remains open and tracking the entities.
### Explicit Loading
Process of loading related entities explicitly, on demand, using the `Load` method.
	**Usage :** In cases you want to control when related data is loaded and avoid the potential overhead of lazy loading.
```C#
using (var context = new BloggingContext())
{
    var blog = context.Blogs.FirstOrDefault();
    // Explicitly load the related posts
    context.Entry(blog).Collection(b => b.Posts).Load();
}
```
- The related posts are explicitly loaded after the blog is fetched. It loads the related posts collection.

| `Definition`  | Loads related entities as part of the initial query.                                           | Loads related entities only when they are accessed for the first time.                          | Loads related entities explicitly on demand.                                                          |
| `Performance` | Reduce the number of database  by loading all necessary data in a single query.                | Loads data only when needed, saving resources if related data is not always accessed.           | Provides fine-grained control over which related entities are loaded and when.                        |
| `Constrol`    | Simple and ensures all required data is available immediately.                                 | Defers loading until data is actually needed.                                                   | Explicit control over when related data is loaded.                                                    |
| `Use cases`   | When you know you'll need related data and want to avoid multiple round-trips to the database. | When related data might not always be needed, and you want to defer loading it until necessary. | When you need fine-grained control over loading related data and want to manage performance manually. |
