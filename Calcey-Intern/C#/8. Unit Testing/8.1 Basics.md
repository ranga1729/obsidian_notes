Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software are tested in isolation from the res of the application. The main reason is to validate that each unit of the software performs as expected. 

### xUnit 
xUnit is a unit testing framework for .NET languages including C#.. 

In unit testing we have to write test classes. 
Test classes includes methods that are marked with `[Fact]` and `[Theory]` attributes. 

### Theory vs. Fact
1. **`[Fact]`** is a test method that has no parameters and is used for tests that are always true. It is the simplest form of a test in xUnit.
	Usage : Test methods that does not need any external data or parameters to run.

Ex:
```C#
using Xunit;

public class MathTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void Test_Addition()
    {
        // Arrange
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;

        // Act
        int result = a + b;

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(15, result);
    }
}

```
- `Arrange` : Set up the necessary objects and prepare the prerequisites for the test.
- `Act` : Perform the actual work or invoke the method to be rested.
- `Assert` : Verify that the outcome is expected.

2. **`[Theory]`** are tests that are true for a particular set of data. You can supply the data using the `[InlineData]` attribute or other data sources.
	Usage : Test method that needs to be tested with different sets of data.
Ex:
```C#
using Xunit;

public class MathTests
{
    [Theory]
    [InlineData(1, 2, 3)]
    [InlineData(-1, -1, -2)]
    [InlineData(10, 20, 30)]
    public void Test_Addition(int a, int b, int expected)
    {
        // Act
        int result = a + b;

        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(expected, result);
    }
}
```
- `Test_Addition` method will run three times with provided sets of data sets specified by the `InlneData` attribute. 

### Assertions
Assertions are used to verify the outcome of the test. 
Common assertions,
1. **Assert.Equal(expected, actual)** : Check if the expected result is matches the actual result.
2. **Assert.NotEqual(expected, actual)** : Checks if the expected result does not match the actual result.
3. **Assert.True(expected, actual)** : Check if the condition is true.
4. **Assert.False(expected, actual)** : Check if the condition is true.
5. **Assert.Throws(expected, actual)** : Check if the specified exception is thrown.

Ex:
```C#
using Xunit;

public class MathTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void Test_Division_By_Zero()
    {
        // Arrange
        int a = 10;
        int b = 0;

        // Act & Assert
        Assert.Throws<DivideByZeroException>(() => Divide(a, b));
    }

    private int Divide(int a, int b)
    {
        return a / b;
    }
}
```

### Fixtures
Test fixtures are used to set up a common context for several tests. This helps in reducing code duplication and managing shared resources. 
In xUnit, use `IClassFixture<T>` interface to create a test fixture.

### Mocking
Mocking is used to create fake objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. This is useful when testing components that depend on external systems or complex objects.
Popular mocking frameworks in C# : Moq, NSubstitute

Ex:
```C#
using Xunit;
using Moq;

public interface IService
{
    int GetData();
}

public class Consumer
{
    private readonly IService _service;

    public Consumer(IService service)
    {
        _service = service;
    }

    public int ProcessData()
    {
        return _service.GetData() * 2;
    }
}

public class ConsumerTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void Test_ProcessData()
    {
        // Arrange
        var mockService = new Mock<IService>();
        mockService.Setup(service => service.GetData()).Returns(5);
        var consumer = new Consumer(mockService.Object);
        // Act
        int result = consumer.ProcessData();
        // Assert
        Assert.Equal(10, result);
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE] AAA Test Structure
> Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern to structure your tests. This makes tests easier to read and maintain.
