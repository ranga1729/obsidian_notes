LINQ queries are used to perform data operations in a declarative manner. 
During database queries, concatenation operations can cause problems for several reasons, 
##### 1. SQL Translation Issues
LINQ queries often translate into SQL queries when using Entity Framework or other ORMs.
SQL does not handle string concatenations in the same ways as C#(or other languages) does. 
	$\therefore$ **Complex concatenations might not be translatable to SQL.**
Can cause runtime errors or inefficient SQL queries. 

##### 2. Performance concerns
Concatenating strings directly in the query can cause the database to perform the concatenation operation. 
This can result slower query execution, specially for larger datasets. 

##### 3. Deferred Execution
LINQ queries have deferred executions.(query is not execution until it is enumerated)
Concatenation operations might behave unexpectedly due to deferred execution, causing logic errors or unexpected results. 

### Solutions
##### 1. Preprocess Data in Memory
Perform concatenation operations after fetching data into memory suing methods like **AsEnumerables()**.
```C#
var searchTerm = "examples";
var query = _dbContext.Products.AsEnumerable()
	.Where(p => (p.Name + " " + p.Description).contains(searchTerm)); //this line happens in memory
```

 ##### 2. Use Anonymous Types
 Select the fields separately and perform the concatenation in memory.
```C#
var searchTerm = "examples";
var query = _dbContext.Products.
	.Select(p => new { p.Name, p.Description }) //data retriveal
	.AsEnumerable()
	.Where(p => (p.Name + " " + p.Description).contains(searchTerm)); //this happens in memory
```

##### 3. Custom SQL functions
Create custom SQL functions to handle complex operations and call these functions from LINQ.
