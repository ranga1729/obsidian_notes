LINQ : Language Integrated Query
LINQ allows you to query and manipulate data using a concise and readable syntax. LINQ provides a rich set of standard query operators like `Where`, `Select`, `Join` for various data processing tasks.

**Types of LINQ,**
1. LINQ to Objects : Foundation for in-memory collections like lists and arrays. 
2. LINQ to SQL : Query relational databases using C# syntax.
3. LINQ to XML : Provide tools to query and transform XML data using C#.
4. Other LINQ providers : Third-party libraries can extend LNQ to work with additional data sources.

**Clauses,**
1. FROM : Specifies the source
2. WHERE : Filters the data based on a condition
3. SELECT : select specific properties 
4. Other : additional clauses like `Join`(combining data from multiple sources), `Order By`(sorting), `Group By`(grouping data).

**Query Syntax Vs. Method Syntax,**
- Query Syntax : Resembles SQL statements, making it easy to read. 
- Method Syntax : Uses a chain of method calls on the data source offering more functional programming style.

Ex: Basic query on a collection
```C#
List<int> number = new List<int> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

//LINQ query to get even numbers
var evenNumbers = 
	from number in numbers 
	where number%2 ==0 
	select number;

//output the result
Console.WriteLine("Even numbers:");
foreach(var number in evenNumbers)
{
	Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

Ex: Filtering and projection
```C#
List<string> fruits = new List<string> {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"};

//LINQ query to get fruits with names longer than 5 characters
var longNamedFruits = 
	from fruit in fruits 
	where fruit.length > 5 
	select fruit.Toupper();

//output the result
foreach(var fruit in longNamedFruits)
{
	Console.WriteLine(fruit);
}
```

Ex: Joining two collections
```C#
public class Customer
{
	public int Customer { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Order
{
	public int OrderId { get; set; }
	public int CustomerId { get; set; }
	public string Product { get; set; }
}

List<Customer> customers = new List<Customers>
{
	new Customer { CustomerId = 1, Name = "John"},
	new Customer { CustomerId = 2, Name = "Jane"}
}

List<Order> orders = new List<Order>
{
	new Order { OrderId = 1, CustomrId = 1, Name = "Book"},
	new Order { OrderId = 2, CustomrId = 2, Name = "Pen"},
	new Order { OrderId = 3, CustomrId = 1, Name = "Notebook"}
}

//LINQ query to join customers and orders
var customerOrders = 
	from customer in customers 
	join order in orders on cutomer.CustomerId equals order.CustomerId
	select new { customer.Name, order.Product };

Console.WriteLine("Customer Order:");
foreach(var item in customerOrders)
{
	Console.WriteLine($"{item.Name} ordered {item.Product}");
}
```

Ex: Aggregating data
```C#
List<int> numbers = new List<int> {1,2,3,4,5};

//LINQ query to get hte sum of the numbers
int sum = (from number in numbers select number).Sum();

//output the result
Console.WrtiteLine($"Sum of the numbers: {sum}");
```

Ex: 
```C#
public class Employee 
{ 
	public string Name { get; set; } 
	public string Department { get; set; } 
}

List<Employee> employee = new List<Employee>
{
	new Employee { Name = "Alice", Department = "HR"},
	new Employee { Name = "Bob", Department = "IT"},
	new Employee { Name = "Charlie", Department = "HR"},
	new Employee { Name = "David", Department = "IT"},
	new Employee { Name = "Eve", Department = "Finance"}
}

var employeeGorups = 
	from employee in employees
	group employee by employee.Department into departmentGroup
	select departmentGroup;

foreach(var group in departmentGroup)
{
	Console.WiteLine($"Department: {group.Key}")
	foreach(var employee in groups)
	{
		Consple.WiteLine($"- {employee.Name}");
	}
	
}

```
