Deferred execution means that the operation isn't performed at the point in the code where the query is declared. The operation is performed only when the query variable is enumerated.

**Lazy Evaluation,**

The second foreach loop executes the query again and returns the latest data. Deferred execution re-evaluates on each execution; this is calledÂ **lazy evaluation**.

This is a major advantage of deferred execution. It always gives you the latest data.
