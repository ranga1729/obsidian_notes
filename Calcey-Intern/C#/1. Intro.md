C# is a programming language and .NET is a framework for building application on windows. Apart from C#, .NET can be used with other languages like F#, vb.net. 

.NET framework consist of two components,
1. CLR (Common Language Runtime)
2. Class Library
### CLR(Common Language Runtime)
#### History of C
Before C#, we had two languages in the C family.
1. C 
2. C++
With these languages, when we compile our program, the compiler translate our code into the native code for the machine on which it was running. 
> [!NOTE] Native code Vs. Machine Code
> - 'Native code' refers to instructions specifically designed for a particular computer's processor (CPU)
> - 'Machine code' is the most fundamental set of instructions a specific CPU can directly understand and execute. It's essentially a series of 0s and 1s representing basic operations the CPU can perform. Not human readable.

For this reason, we can not run the native code, on another system consist of different hardware. 
When Microsoft developed C# and the .NET framework they got the solution for issue from the Java community. 

> [!NOTE] Java's JRE and C#'s CLR
> - Java doesn't compile into machine/native code, instead it compile into a intermediate form called 'Bytecode'. This ByteCode can be run on any machine with the Java runtime Environment(JRE).

When C# code is compiled, the result is an **"IL Code"**(Intermediate Language Code). It independent of the computer. Now **CLR**(Common language Runtime) comes to convert that IL Code into native code.
This process is called **"Just in Time compilation(JIT)"**

With this architecture, you don't have to worry about compiling that code into the native code for different machines. As long as a machine has CLR, that can run your application. 

### Architecture of .NET Applications

#### Classes

	**At a very high level**, .NET applications consist of building blocks of classes.
A class is consist of data(attributes) and functions(methods).
#### Namespace

As the number of classes inn an application grows, it need a way to organize these classes. Namespaces are containers for related classes. 
Ex: In .NET we have namespaces for,
	working with data like databases
	working with graphics and images,
	working with security
#### Assembly

As namespaces grow, we need a different way of partitioning an application. That's where we use an assembly. 
Assembly is a container for related namespaces. Physically it's a file on the disk which can be either 
1. an executable(EXE) or 
2. a DLL(Dynamically Linked Library)

When we compile an application, the compiler builds one or more assemblies depending on how you partition your code.
