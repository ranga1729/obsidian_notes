### Model contexts
Model contexts typically refers to the **DBContext class** used with Entity Framework. 
- **Entity Framework is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that simplifies working with databases in .NET applications.**
- The **DBContext class** acts as a bridge between your data model(represented by classes) and the underlying database.

*Key responsibilities of DbContext,*
- Serves as a central class that embodies your database connection and access logic.
- Define how your application's classes(entities) correspond to database tables(Dbsets).
- Perform CRUD operations on your data model using DbContext methods like `Add`, `Find`, `Update` and `Remove`.
- Keep track of changes made to your entities and allows you to save those changes to the database using `SaveChanges`.
*Considerations regarding DbContext,*
- DbContext resides in a separate data access layer to promote separation of concerns. 
- Entity Framework's behavior can be customized through the DbContext class. 
- Implementation details of DbContext might be vary on the entity Framework version.(Ex: EF6, EF Core)

### ORM
Stands for **"Object Relational Mapper"**.
ORM acts as a bridge between OOP and Relational Databases.
- OOP --> Represent data using classes and objects. These classes define the properties(attributes) of data and the methods(functions) that operate on that data.

*Why ORMs ??*
the way data is organized in OOP and RDB is fundamentally deferent. 
This can cause challenges when developing applications that interact with databases. 
- ORM maps the classes in your objects-oriented program to tables in the relational databases. 
- ORM provide a way to interact with the database using your objects instead of writing complex SQL statements directly. 
- ORMs shield your application from the specifics of the underlying database, making it easier to switch databases if needed. 

Additionally, 
- ORMs keeps track of changes made to your objects and allow you to efficiently save those changes to the database.
- Some ORMs allow you to query your data using LINQ(Language Integrated Query) which provide a familiar syntax for working with objects. 


EX:
```c#
public class LibraryContext : DbContext
{
    public LibraryContext(DbContextOptions<LibraryContext> options) : base(options)
    {
    }
    public DbSet<Book> Books { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Author> Authors { get; set; }
}

public class Book
{
    public int BookId { get; set; } // Primary Key
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public int PublicationYear { get; set; }

    // Foreign Key relationship with Author
    public int AuthorId { get; set; }
    public Author Author { get; set; }
}

public class Author
{
    public int AuthorId { get; set; } // Primary Key
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Country { get; set; }

    // Navigation property (one author can have many books)
    public ICollection<Book> Books { get; set; }
}

```
- **LibraryContext** Class : Inherits from the `DbContext` and serves as the central  point for interacting with the database. Defines the connection details though the constructor. 
- **DbSet** : The class defines two `Dbset` properties, 'Book' and 'Author'. These properties map to the corresponding tables(`Book` and `Author`)in the database. 
- **Book** Class : Represents a book entity with properties like `BookId`, `Title`, `PublicationYear`, and a foreign key `AuthorId`. It also has a navigation property `Author` to access the related author object.
- **Author** Class : Represents a author entity with properties. It has a navigation property `Book` as a collection to hold all the books written by that author. 

- `get;` is a getter used to retrieve value of that property. 
	The code within `get;` is executed when you access the property suing dot notation.
	Ex:`book.Title`
- `set;` is a setter used to set a value for that property. 
	The code within `set;` is executed when you set a value to a property suing the assignment operator.
	Ex:`book.Title = "New Title"`
**You can have only a `get` accessor for read-only properties and/or only a `set;` accessor for write-only properties.**
**Since C# provide the implementation of these accessors you can omit the implementation.**

Entity Framework
- Code first
- Model first
- Fluent API
- Query Syntax
- Lambda Syntax

## Entity Framework
EF is an ORM used in .NET Framework Core.

![[Pasted image 20240605083419.png]]
- EF provide us  class, **DbContext**, which is a gateway to  our database.
- DbContext can have one or more **DbSet**, which represents table in the database. 
![[Pasted image 20240605083900.png]]
- We use **LINQ** queries to query these DbSets. 
- EF translates these LINQ queries to SQL queries at runtime. We don't have to do this translation manually 
EF is responsible for,
1. Opening a connection to the database.
2. Reading of data.
3. Map data to the objects. 
4. Add them back to the DbSets.
5. Return the DbContext back to us.

![[Pasted image 20240605084122.png]]
As we modify, add or remove objects in these DbSets, entity framework keep track o these changes. When we ask to persist these changes it will automatically generate SQL statements and execute them on the database. 

**Workflows when working with Entity Framework,**
1. Database First approach
2. Code First Approach
3. Model First Approach
#### 1. Database first Approach
1. Design and create your database schema using tools like SQL Server Management studio or any other database management tool.
2. Use tools provided by your ORM or database management system to generate classes(entities) based on the existing database schema. These classes represent  the data structure of your tables. 
#### 2. Code First Approach
1. Define your data model entities using a programming language with properties and data annotations. These annotations provide metadata about the data and its relationship to the database. 
2. The ORM manages database creation and schema based on your classes. It translate your code into the underlying database schema when the application connects to the database for the first time or when explicitly instructed to create the schema.
#### 3. Model First
1. We use a visual designer to model our classes and their associations. These are basically UML diagrams. 
2. Based on these diagrams entity framework generates classes and database for us.

**Domain/Model class,**
Domain/Model class represents a real-world entity. 
Ex: 
	Employee, Manager
	In OOP, we create classes to represent these entities. We call such classes as domain classes. 
To create a models class,
1. Create a folder called **Models** in your project folder. 
2. Add your model classes in this folder. 
	![[Pasted image 20240605104012.png]]
3. Create a Folder named **Data** and create a DbContext class within it. 
**DbContext,**
DbContext is a class where that is used to interact with the database. 
This class includes many definitions.  **DbContextOptionBuilder** is a parameter in thins method. 
Ex: 
	onConfiguring() : We must override this method to give DB information.
*In ASP.NET Core we setup the connection string on **appsettings.json** file.*
![[Pasted image 20240605133429.png]]
Then we use the connection string on **Program.cs**
### Fluent API
Fluent API is an integral part of Entity Framework.
