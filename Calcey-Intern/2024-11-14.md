Reviewed the front end of the select order history with Nuwan.
Did some suggested changes to that and Created a PR.

There was another task a to add a button in the select menu items tab in a way that it will navigate the user to the meal variations tab and show related variations to that selected menu items. 

Had an issue with that PR, fixed that. 

will continue order for that.
