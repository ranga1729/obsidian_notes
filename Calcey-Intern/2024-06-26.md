### SCRUM
DONE
- I started working on xUnit testing.
- Had a KT with Nuwan and got an insight about xUnit testing from him.
- He gave me 2 sample API tasks. 
- I completed both of them and they are working.

TODAY
- I will have another huddle with Nuwan to review that sample tasks.
- Then I will continue learning about xUnit testing and I need to complete another couple of videos from the .NET tutorial list as well.
