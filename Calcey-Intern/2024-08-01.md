### SCRUM
- Had a KT with Nuwan, and Wageesha. 
- Resolved some issues in the PR of the meal ratings task. Now it's good to go i think.
- Worked on the sample task.
- Worked on the ingredient-allergen query that Emma requested.
	Even though it's not clear what Emma says, I wrote 
```sql
select distinct "Recipes"."Name" as "Recipe Name", "Ingredients"."Name" as "Ingredient" from "RecipeIngredients" 
   join "Recipes" on "RecipeIngredients"."RecipeId"="Recipes"."Id"
   join "Ingredients" on "RecipeIngredients"."IngredientId"="Ingredients"."Id"
   where "Ingredients"."Allergen"=true
   Order by "Recipes"."Name";
```
```sql
SELECT "Name", "Allergen" FROM "Ingredients" Order by "Allergen" desc;
```
