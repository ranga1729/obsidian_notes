Fixed some suggested changes of the order-history front-end part. 
Then started to work on the order-form. 
There was a new method that suggested by Nuwan regarding the scrolling up functionality. 
I have tested that to the 1st page of the order form. 
Currently,  I'm applying all those changes to the other pages as well.
