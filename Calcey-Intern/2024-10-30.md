Mostly I worked on the Order-form task, trying to fix the issue I have faced with asynchronous functions there. Then I had a call with Nuwan. We did some changes. But the issue is still there. I will work on that today.
And I tested the select order history back-end API modifications and noticed credits and token values are not working correctly. I'm currently fixing that issue. Then I will move on to the Order-form issue.

check the orderPlacementDate(Done)
How to check tokens and credits ?

```C#
var transactionLedgers = _dataContext.TransactionLines
   .Where(tl => tl.Transaction.OrderId == order.Id)
   .GroupBy(tl => tl.LedgerCodeId)
   .Select(group => new 
   {
      LedgerCodeId = group.Key,
      Amount = group.Sum(tl => tl.Amount),
   }).ToDictionary(g => g.LedgerCodeId, g => g.Amount);



DietaryPreferenceIds = new List<string> {log.DietaryPreferenceIds},
```
