### SCRUM
DONE
- I managed to make input field borders red in the order form in case of the user clicked "Next" with unfilled fields. But since there were some prop drillings into deeper components and changing some generic components specifically for that task, Chomal said that approach is not good. So I'm taking another approach to do the same job. created a New Next button component suitable for that situation.

TODAY
- Will continue do the rest of the things today.
- There is a QA response about that meal-ratings task. Will fix that also. 

Questions
- Red font class from UI engineer.
	"Goal is required." 
	font should be in red, title should be changed as above. 
	change the title, add "(Optional)" to optional fields. 
- Who to assign 'guest-order' task. (Nushrath)
