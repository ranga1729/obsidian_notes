Yester I mostly worked on my Previous PRs, Some of them has merge conflicts and had to resolve them. 
One PR has a issue and I will have a huddle with Nuwan Today to discuss about it. 
I will create PR on the front end of the Order history task once Nuwan review it. 
And I think I can work on the Order-Form after that.
