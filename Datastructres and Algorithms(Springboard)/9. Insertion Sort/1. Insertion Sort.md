Similar to bubble sort and selection sort.
It builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left portion which is always sorted.

Sorted portion is shown in green. 
Steps,
1st line: We consider 5(left portion) is sorted already. Looking for a place to put 3 in the sorted portion.
2nd line: We consider 3, 5(left portion) is sorted already. Looking for a place to put 4 in the sorted portion.
3rd line: We consider 3, 4, 5(left portion) is sorted already. Looking for a place to put 1 in the sorted portion.
4th line: We consider 1, 3, 4, 5(left portion) is sorted already. Looking for a place to put 2 in the sorted portion.
5th line:  

We are building the sorted portion of the array by inserting one item at a time in the correct place. 

Inserting one value at a time. That's why it's called insertion sort algorithm. 

#### Pseudocode
We consider the first element is already sorted. 
- Start by picking the second element.
- Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary.
- Continue to next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion(left side) to place the element in the correct position.
```js
function insertionSort(arr){
	for(var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++){
		var currentVal = arr[i];
		for(var j = i-1; j >= 0 && arr[j] > currentVal; j--){
			arr[j+1] = arr[j];
		}
		arr[j+1] = currentVal;
	}
	return arr;
}
```

#### Time complexity of Insertion Sort
Worst case : **Big O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
	As far as the array grows, we have to do n<sup>2</sup> comparisons.
	Worst scenario could be when you try to sort an descending ordered array into ascending order.
	Ex: [4, 3, 2, 1]
Best Case : **Big O(n)**
	If you data is nearly sorted.
	Ex: [2, 1, 76, 4]

Use case:
Insertion sort is known as the "Online algorithm" because this algorithm can work as data is coming in, as it receives new data. It doesn't have to have the entire array at once.
