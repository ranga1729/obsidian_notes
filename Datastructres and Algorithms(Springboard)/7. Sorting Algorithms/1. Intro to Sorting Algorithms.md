Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection(Ex: an array) so that the items are in some kind of a order. 
Ex:
- Sorting numbers from smallest to largest.
- Sorting names alphabetically.

### Built-in JavaScript Sorting
JavaScript is come with a built in sorting algorithm.
```js
["Steele", "Colt", "Data Structure", "Algorithms"].sort()
//["Algorithms", "Colt", "Data Structure", "Steele"]

[6, 4, 15, 10].sort()
//[10, 15, 4, 6]
```
The first output is sorted.
2nd one is not in any order even it's sorted.

**Reason :** The default JS sorting algorithm work on string Unicode code point.
Every item in the array is converted to a string and then the Unicode value of that strings are taken and sorted based on that.

#### Solution: Telling JavaScript how to sort.
The built-in sort method accepts an optional ==comparator function.==
You can use this comparator function to tell JavaScript how you want it to sort. 
- The comparator looks at pairs of elements(a and b) determines their sort order based on the return value.
- ==*If it returns a negative number, a should come before b.*==
- ==*If it returns a positive number, a should come after b.*==
- ==*If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned.*== 

Ex:
```js
function numberCompare(num1, num2){
	return num1 - num2;
}
//If this returns a negative number, num1 comes before num2.
//If this returns a positive number, num2 comes before num1.
//promoting ascending order.

[6, 4, 15, 10].sort(numberCompare)
//[4, 6, 10, 15]

function numberCompare(num1, num2){
	return num2 - num1;
}
//promoting descending order.
[6, 4, 15, 10].sort(numberCompare)
//[15, 10, 6, 4]
```
