A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top !
AKA Sinking sort, where the largest values sink to the end, to the bottom.

Ex:
Sort [5, 3, 4, 1, 2]
![[Pasted image 20240222110018.png]]
Steps:
- Compare 5 & 3. (5 > 3) Swap.
- Compare 5 & 4. (5 > 4) Swap.
- Compare 5 & 1. (5 > 1) Swap.
- Compare 5 & 2. (5 > 2) Swap.
Now 5, the largest number is at the end of the list. 
Now we have to take care about the other 4 values. 
We have to repeat this process over and over to sort the whole list. 
As we go through, the items we need to sort decreases.

#### Swap
Many sorting algorithms involved some types of swapping functionality. 
```js
//ES5
function swap(arr, index1, index2){
	var temp = arr[index1];
	arr[index1] = arr[index2];
	arr[index2] = temp;
}
```
```js
//ES2015 is provided with new syntax to do swap
const swap = (arr, index1, index2) => {
	[arr[index1], arr[index2]] = [arr[index2], arr[index1]];
}
```

#### Pseudocode,
1. Start looping from the variable called `i` the end of the array towards the beginning. 
2. Start an inner loop with a variable `j` from the beginning until `i-1`
3. If `arr[j]` is greater than `arr[j+1]`, swap those two values !

Less optimized way
```js
function bubbleSort(arr){
	for(var i = arr.length; i > 0; i--){
		for(var j = 0; j < i-1; j++){
			if(arr[j] > arr[j+1]){
				//swap
				var temp = arr[j];
				arr[j] = arr[j+1];
				arr[j+1] = temp;
			}
		}
	}
	return arr;
}
```

**Problem with this solution,**
If our list/array is almost sorted, the loops will still work on the whole array.
![[Pasted image 20240222123822.png]]
This array is sorted out already. But loops don't know it. They run until they hit the conditions. 
If the array is super long, it going to be a huge problem. 

solution: Check the last time whether we made any swaps or not. If not, that means, it's already sorted.

**Optimized solution**
```js
function bubbleSort(arr){
	var noSwaps;
	for(var i = arr.length; i > 0; i--){
		noSwaps = true;
		for(var j = 0; j < i-1; j++){
			if(arr[j] > arr[j+1]){
				//swap
				var temp = arr[j];
				arr[j] = arr[j+1];
				arr[j+1] = temp;

				noSwaps = false;
			}
		}
		if(noSwaps){
			break;
		}
	}
	return arr;
}
```

This solution will sort out the array by doing swaps and then go a one last time through the array without any swaps. 
In that round `noSwaps = true` and break out of the arrays.

#### Time complexity of bubble sort
- Best Case - Array is almost sorted already or sorted.
	1st round: Complete the sort by swapping.
	2nd round: Check the array.
	If the array has n elements,
		This is **Big O(2n)**
		Generalized into **Big O(n)**

- Worst case - Nothing is sorted.
	Two loops are running and a one is a nested loops.
	If the array has n items, **Big O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
