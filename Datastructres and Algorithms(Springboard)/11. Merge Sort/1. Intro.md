Problems with Bubble, Selection, Insertion sort,
- They don't scale well. 
	They work pretty fast but they do not scale well. They actually work well with small arrays like 20.

Faster sorts,
- There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from **O(n<sup>2</sup>)** to **O(n.log n)**.
- There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity. 
- There are more efficient algorithms are much less simple and generally take longer to understand.
