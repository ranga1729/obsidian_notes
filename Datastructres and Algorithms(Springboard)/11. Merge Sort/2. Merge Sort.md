Merge sort was written by John Von Neumann. 
It was 23 pages and wrote for EDVAC. 

- Merge sort is a combination of,
1. Splitting up
2. Sorting
3. Merging 

- It exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 elements are always sorted. 
- It works by decomposing and array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building up a newly sorted array. So, this is a 'divide and conquer' approach.
Ex: We take an 8 elements array and split up again and again until we end up with eight single elements. An then we merge them back together.

#### Merging Arrays
- In order to implement merger sort, it's useful to first implement a function responsible for merging two sorted arrays. 
- Given two arrays which are sorted, this helper function should create a new array which is also sorted and consist of all of the elements in the two input arrays. 
- This function should run in **O(n+m)** time and **O(n+m)** space and should not modify the parameters passed to it. 
	n: size of the 1st sorted array
	m: size of the 2nd sorted array
	meaning of **O(n+m)** : we are iterating over each item in each array once. 

**Pseudocode,**
1. Create an empty array.
2. Take a look at the smallest values in each input array.
3. While there are still values we haven't looked at, 
	If the value in the first array is smaller than the value in the second array, push the value in the first array into our results and move on to the next value in the array.
	If the value in the first array is larger than the value in the second array, push the value in the second array into our results and move on to the next value in the array.
4. Once we exhaust one array, push in all remaining values from the other array.
```js
function merge(arr1, arr2){
	let result = {};
	let i = 0;
	let j = 0;
	while(i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length){
		if(arr2[j] > arr1[i]){
			reuslts.push(arr1[i]);
			i++;
		}else {
			results.push(arr2[j]);
			j++;
		}
	}
	while(i < arr1.length){
		results.push(arr1[i]);
		i++;
	}
	while(j < arr2.length){
		results.push(arr2[j]);
		j++;
	}
	return results;
}
```

**Merge Sort Pseudocode,**
1. Break up the array into halves until you have arrays that are empty or have one element. 
	**slice()** method can be used.
2. When you go the two half arrays, you are going to break each half into its own halves and keep going recursively until we get sub arrays of length 1 or 0. (Base case)
3. Once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge those arrays with other sorted arrays until you are back at the full length of the array.
4. Once the array has been merged back together, return the merged and sorted array. 

```js
//merge function
function merge(arr1, arr2){
	let result = {};
	let i = 0;
	let j = 0;
	while(i < arr1.length && j < arr2.length){
		if(arr2[j] > arr1[i]){
			reuslts.push(arr1[i]);
			i++;
		}else {
			results.push(arr2[j]);
			j++;
		}
	}
	while(i < arr1.length){
		results.push(arr1[i]);
		i++;
	}
	while(j < arr2.length){
		results.push(arr2[j]);
		j++;
	}
	return results;

//mergeSoter function
function mergeSort(arr){
	if(arr.length <= 1){
		return arr;
	}
	let mid = Math.floor(arr.length/2)
	let left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));
	let right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));
	return merge(left, right)
}
```

#### Big O of Merge Sort

| Time complexity(Best) | Time complexity(Average) | Time complexity(Worst) | Space complexity |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| O(n.log n)            | O(n.log n)               | O(n.log n)             | O(n)             |

Explanation
![[Pasted image 20240223101203.png]]
If we have an array with 8 items, it takes 3 steps to split all of them into single item arrays by dividing them to half at each step. 
If we have 32 items, it takes 5 steps.
2<sup>3</sup> = 8
steps = 3 
log<sub>2</sub> 8 = 3

2<sup>5</sup> = 32
steps = 5 
log<sub>2</sub> 32 = 5

**Decomposition steps = log<sub>2</sub> n**

In each step, while merging, we have **O(n)** comparisons.
Ex:
[3,4,5,8]  [1,2,6,7]
step 1: 3 & 1
step 2: 3 & 2
step 3: 3 & 6
step 4: 4 & 6
step 5: 5 & 6
step 6: 6 & 8
step 7: 8 & 7
step 8: 8

As the length of this n grows, the merge takes time complexity of **O(n)**

Together both of processes,
Time complexity = **O(n.log n)**

When we have n items array, we need to split them up to n times single item arrays. This takes spaces from our memory. 
Space complexity = **O(n)**

Use cases: Merger sort doesn't care about the number. It just blindly split them up and merge them together in a order. 
If we need a 'data agnostic' algorithm, merger sort is the best solution.
