##Note
**What is a Binary Search Tree?**
- **Ordering Principle:** A Binary Search Tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children (left and right), and they are arranged in a specific order:
    - **Left Child:** Must contain a value smaller than the parent node.
    - **Right Child:** Must contain a value greater than the parent node.
- **Hierarchical Structure:** This rule is applied recursively, creating a tree-like structure where searching for elements becomes very efficient.

**Benefits of Binary Search Trees**
- **Efficient Search, Insertion, and Deletion:** Due to the ordering, you can traverse the tree strategically, halving the search space with each comparison. This leads to a logarithmic time complexity in most cases.
- **Sorted Data:** A BST naturally maintains sorted data. When you perform an in-order traversal, you get the elements in ascending order.

**Downside of Binary Search Trees**
- **Potential Imbalance:** In the worst-case scenario (a completely skewed tree where elements are continually added in ascending or descending order), the BST can degrade into a linked list, losing efficiency. Balancing techniques (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees) are used to mitigate this issue.

**Time Complexity (Average Cases)**
- **Search:** O(log n) - where 'n' is the number of elements
- **Insertion:** O(log n)
- **Deletion:** O(log n)

**Space Complexity**
- **O(n):** The space used by the BST grows linearly with the number of elements 'n' it contains.

**Real-World Examples:**

- **Databases and Search Engines:** BSTs or their variants (B-Trees) are often used to index data for fast lookups and retrieval.
- **Symbol Tables in Compilers:** A symbol table stores identifiers (variable names, function names) in a way that allows quick lookup and insertions. BSTs can implement symbol tables.
- **Autocomplete:** Think of the suggested words when you start typing in a search bar. Many implementations use a structure called a Trie, which has similarities with BSTs.

**Important Notes**

- The time complexities mentioned are for balanced or near-balanced BSTs. Worst-case scenarios with highly unbalanced trees can approach O(n) (linear time).
- There are self-balancing Binary Search Trees such as AVL trees and Red-Black trees that maintain a balanced structure to ensure logarithmic time complexity.

****
**Best Case:**

- **Search:** O(1) (Constant Time)
- **Insertion:** O(1) (Constant Time)
- **Deletion:** O(1) (Constant Time)

This surprisingly efficient performance occurs when the search target or element to be inserted/deleted is located at the root node itself. Since the root is the first node checked, it takes only one comparison (constant time) to find it.

**Worst Case:**

- **Search:** O(n) (Linear Time)
- **Insertion:** O(n) (Linear Time)
- **Deletion:** O(n) (Linear Time)

This scenario arises when the BST becomes completely **skewed**. This means all elements are inserted in strictly ascending or descending order, resulting in a structure similar to a linked list, where each node only has one child. In this case, every search, insertion, or deletion requires traversing the entire tree, leading to a linear time complexity of O(n).

**Reasons for Skewed Trees:**

- **Repetitive insertions:** If you repeatedly insert elements in the same order (ascending or descending), the tree will become skewed.
- **Unbalanced data:** If the data being inserted is inherently sorted or has a specific pattern, it can lead to a skewed tree.

**Avoiding Worst Case:**

To prevent worst-case scenarios and maintain efficient BST operations, several techniques are used:

- **Self-balancing BSTs:** Data structures like AVL trees and Red-Black trees implement specific rules and rotations to ensure the tree remains balanced after each operation, guaranteeing logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)) for search, insertion, and deletion in average and worst-case scenarios.
- **Randomized insertion:** Randomizing the order in which elements are inserted can help prevent skewed trees even with sorted or patterned data.

In summary, while a balanced BST offers efficient search, insertion, and deletion with O(log n) time complexity, understanding the worst-case scenario of O(n) due to skewness is crucial. Balancing techniques and considerations during data insertion are essential to maintain a BST's efficiency in practical applications.

**Node Structure**

```
struct Node {
  data: any
  left: Node
  right: Node
}
```

**Search Function**

```
function search(root: Node, value: any): Node?
  if root == null then
    return null
  else if value < root.data then
    return search(root.left, value)
  else if value > root.data then
    return search(root.right, value)
  else
    return root
```

**Insert Function**

```
function insert(root: Node, value: any): Node
  if root == null then
    return new Node(value)
  else if value < root.data then
    root.left = insert(root.left, value)
  else if value > root.data then
    root.right = insert(root.right, value)
  return root
```

**In-order Traversal (prints values)**

```
function inorder(root: Node)
  if root != null then
    inorder(root.left)
    print(root.data)
    inorder(root.right)
```

This pseudocode defines a `Node` structure with data and links to left and right child nodes. The functions implement:

- `search`: Searches for a value in the tree and returns the corresponding node or null if not found.
- `insert`: Inserts a new value into the tree while maintaining the binary search property.
- `inorder`: Performs an in-order traversal of the tree, printing the node values.
