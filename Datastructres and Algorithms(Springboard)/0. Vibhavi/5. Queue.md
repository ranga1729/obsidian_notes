**What is a Queue?**
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** principle. Elements are added to the **back** of the queue (enqueue) and removed from the **front** (dequeue). Imagine a line of people waiting for a service. The first person in line gets served first, just like elements in a queue.

**Benefits of Queues:**
- **Simplicity:** Queues are relatively easy to understand and implement.
- **Efficient for FIFO Operations:** When the processing order matters and the oldest element needs to be processed first, queues are highly efficient.
- **Limited Memory Consumption:** Unlike some data structures that might need to resize dynamically, queues generally have a fixed size, preventing excessive memory usage.

**Downsides of Queues:**
- **Limited Access:** You can only access and directly manipulate the element at the front of the queue (unless the implementation allows peek operations). Modifying or removing elements in the middle can be cumbersome.
- **Potential Overflow/Underflow:** With fixed-size implementations, you risk overflow (trying to add to a full queue) or underflow (trying to remove from an empty queue).

**Time Complexity:**
- **Enqueue** (add to the back): O(1) - Constant time, as it's a simple operation at the end.
- **Dequeue** (remove from the front): O(1) - Constant time for the same reason.
- **Peek** (view the front element): O(1) - Constant time, if the implementation allows it.
- **Search:** O(n) - Linear time, as you might need to traverse the entire queue to find a specific element.

**Space Complexity:**
- **O(n):** The space used by a queue typically grows linearly with the number of elements (n) it holds.

**Real-World Scenarios where Queues are Used:**
- **Task Scheduling:** Operating systems use queues to manage processes and allocate CPU time. Tasks are added to the queue and are processed one after the other.
- **Data Processing Pipelines:** Many data processing systems utilize queues to pass data from one stage to the next in a sequential flow.
- **Printers:** Queues are used to buffer print jobs, ensuring they are processed in the order they were received.
- **Network Buffers:** Network devices often use queues to buffer incoming and outgoing data packets, handling them efficiently.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm:** This graph traversal algorithm uses a queue to explore neighboring nodes level by level.

**Comparison with Stacks:**
While both queues and stacks are linear data structures, they have fundamental differences:
- **Order:** Queues follow FIFO (First-In-First-Out), while stacks follow LIFO (Last-In-First-Out).
- **Access and Manipulation:** Queues allow adding and removing elements only at the front and back, respectively. Stacks allow operations only at the top.
- **Use Cases:** Queues are well-suited for FIFO scenarios, while stacks are often used for function calls, backtracking, and expression evaluation.

same as stack.
use push(), pop() methods same as in stack. 
when it comes to peek() : use `return this.arr[0];`

push() --> enqueue(element)
pop() --> 
dequeue() { 
	if (this.isEmpty()) { 
		return null; // Indicate empty queue 
	} 
	return this.items.shift(); 
}
size() --> return arr.length();

```
// Define the Queue ADT

data Queue
  front: integer  // Index of the front element
  rear: integer   // Index of the rear element
  maxSize: integer // Maximum size of the queue
  items: array of any

// Function to initialize an empty queue
function initializeQueue(queue: Queue)
  queue.front = -1
  queue.rear = -1

// Function to check if the queue is empty
function isEmpty(queue: Queue)
  return queue.front == -1

// Function to check if the queue is full
function isFull(queue: Queue)
  return queue.rear == queue.maxSize - 1

// Function to enqueue an item
function enqueue(queue: Queue, item: any)
  if isFull(queue) then
    print("Queue Overflow")
  else
    if isEmpty(queue) then
      queue.front = 0
    queue.rear = queue.rear + 1
    queue.items[queue.rear] = item

// Function to dequeue an item
function dequeue(queue: Queue)
  if isEmpty(queue) then
    print("Queue Underflow")
  else
    item := queue.items[queue.front]
    if queue.front == queue.rear then
      initializeQueue(queue)  // Reset queue if only one element
    else
      queue.front = queue.front + 1
    return item
```

This pseudocode defines a `Queue` data structure with `front`, `rear`, `maxSize`, and `items` variables. The functions implement:

- `initializeQueue`: Initializes an empty queue.
- `isEmpty`: Checks if the queue is empty.
- `isFull`: Checks if the queue is full.
- `enqueue`: Adds an item to the end of the queue.
- `dequeue`: Removes and returns the front item from the queue.
