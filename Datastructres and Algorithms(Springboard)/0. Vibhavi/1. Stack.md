## Note

**What is a Stack?**
- **Analogy:** Think of a stack of plates in your kitchen. You add plates one on top of the other, and you always remove the topmost plate first.
- **LIFO:** A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **L**ast **I**n, **F**irst **O**ut (LIFO) principle. The last element you put on the stack is the first one you take off.
- **Operations:**
    - **Push:** Adding an element to the top of the stack.
    - **Pop:** Removing the element from the top of the stack.
    - **Peek/Top:** Looking at the top element without removing it.

**Benefits of Stacks**
- **Simple to Implement:** Stacks are relatively easy to create and manipulate, often implemented with arrays or linked lists.
- **Efficient Backtracking:** Think of your web browser's "Back" button. It keeps a stack of visited URLs, allowing you to retrace your steps in reverse order.
- **Expression Evaluation:** Compilers use stacks to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions (e.g., infix to postfix conversion).
- **Undo Functionality:** Many text editors and software use a stack to track changes allowing you to undo actions.

**Downsides of Stacks**
- **Limited Access:** You can only directly access and manipulate the top element. To reach elements deeper in the stack, you need to pop off the ones above them.
- **Potential Overflow/Underflow:** With fixed-size implementations, you risk overflow (trying to add to a full stack) or underflow (trying to remove from an empty stack).

**Time Complexity**
- **Push:** O(1) (Constant Time) - Adding to the top is straightforward.
- **Pop:** O(1) (Constant Time) - Removing from the top is immediate.
- **Peek/Top:** O(1) (Constant Time) - Inspecting the top element is also fast.

**Space Complexity**
- **O(n):** The space used by a stack grows linearly with the number of elements (n) it holds.

**Real-World Examples**
- **Call Stack in Programming:** Each time a function is called, its information is pushed onto a stack. When it returns, its information is popped. This manages function execution order.
- **Parenthesis Matching:** Stacks are used to ensure that parentheses in code or expressions are properly balanced.
- **Memory Management (Allocation/Deallocation):** Some systems use a stack-based approach to keep track of memory for local variables.

```
// Define the Stack ADT

data Stack
  top: integer
  items: array of any

// Function to initialize an empty stack
function initializeStack(stack: Stack)
  stack.top = -1

// Function to check if the stack is empty
function isEmpty(stack: Stack)
  return stack.top == -1

// Function to check if the stack is full (assuming a fixed size array)
function isFull(stack: Stack, maxSize: integer)
  return stack.top == maxSize - 1

// Function to push an item onto the stack
function push(stack: Stack, item: any)
  if isFull(stack, maxSize) then
    print("Stack Overflow")
  else
    stack.top = stack.top + 1
    stack.items[stack.top] = item

// Function to pop an item from the stack
function pop(stack: Stack)
  if isEmpty(stack) then
    print("Stack Underflow")
  else
    removedItem = stack.items[stack.top]
    stack.top = stack.top - 1
    return removedItem

// Function to peek at the top item of the stack
function peek(stack: Stack)
  if isEmpty(stack) then
    print("Stack Underflow")
  else
    return stack.items[stack.top]
```

This pseudocode defines a `Stack` data type with a `top` pointer and an `items` array. The functions implement:

- `initializeStack`: Initializes an empty stack.
- `isEmpty`: Checks if the stack is empty.
- `isFull`: Checks if the stack is full (considering a fixed size).
- `push`: Adds an item to the stack.
- `pop`: Removes and returns the top item from the stack.
- `peek`: Returns the top item without removing it.
