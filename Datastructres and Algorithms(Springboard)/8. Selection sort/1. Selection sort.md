Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position.
It looks for the smallest values in the array first, then place the smallest value at the beginning.
(smallest is in green color)

- Compare 5 & 3. 3 is small.
- Compare 3 & 4. 3 is small.
- Compare 3 & 1. 1 is small.
- Compare 1 & 2. 1 is small.
- Place 1 at the beginning of the array.
We do the same process again and again until the array gets sorted.

#### Pseudocode
1. Store the first element as the smallest value you have seen so far.
2. Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number. 
3. If the next item is smaller, now we update the value of the minimum to be that next item. (We don't save that value, we save the index of the minimum value.)
4. Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.
With the steps are going on, beginning of the array is getting sorted. We just have to care about the rest of the array.

```js
function selectionSort(arr){
	for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
		var lowest = i;
		for(var j = i+1; j < arr.length; j++){
			if(arr[j] < arr[lowest]){
				lowest = j;
			}
		}
		if(i !== lowest){
			var temp = arr[i];
			arr[i] = arr[lowest];
			arr[lowest] = temp;
		}
	}
	return arr
}
```

#### Big O of Selection sort
Roughly we are comparing every element to every other element in the array. 
Since two loops are involved as nested one inside another,
time complexity of selection sort is **Big O(n<sup>2</sup>)**

selection sort is potentially better than bubble sort. 
In a situation where you have to make minimum number of swaps/memory writing, Selection sort is better than bubble sort.
