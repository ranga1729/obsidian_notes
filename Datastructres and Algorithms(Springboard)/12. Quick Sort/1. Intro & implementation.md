- Same as merge sort, exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted. 
- Works by selecting one element (called the "pivot") and move all the numbers that re lower than the pivot to the left of pivot and move all the numbers higher than the pivot to the right side of the pivot. 
	End of this process, we know that the pivot is at the correct position of that array. 
- Then we repeat the process by choosing either right or left side. 

Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240223112438.png]]
We pick 5 as pivot. 
![[Pasted image 20240223112453.png]]
Now we move all the numbers less than 5 to the left side and all the numbers higher than 5 to the right side. 
Since we have 1, 2, 3 and 4, 5 should be in the 4th index/5th position.
![[Pasted image 20240223112723.png]]
Lets select another pivot(3) from the left side. 
![[Pasted image 20240223112806.png]]
1 & 2 are less than 3 which means 2nd index/3rd position should belongs to the 3. 
![[Pasted image 20240223112921.png]]
Lets select 1 as the next pivot. 
![[Pasted image 20240223113001.png]]
2 is higher than the 1. 2 should come to the right side of the 1.
![[Pasted image 20240223113045.png]]
Now lets get to the right side.
Select 7 as the pivot point.
![[Pasted image 20240223113139.png]]
6 is less than 7 and 8 is higher than 7. 
7 should become at the middle of the 6 and 8.

### Pivot Helper
This is the function responsible arranging elements in an array on either side of a pivot. 
- This helper function should designate and element as the pivot. 
- It should then rearrange elements in the array so that all values less than the pivot are moved to the left of the pivot and all values greater than the pivot are moved to the right of the pivot. 
- Order of the either sides doesn't matter. 
- Helper should do this in place, without creating a new array. 
- Then it should return the index of the pivot.

#### Picking a pivot.
- The runtime of quick sort depends in part on how one selects the pivot. 
- Ideally, the pivot should be chosen so that it's roughly the median value in the data set you are sorting. 
	But that's not easy.
- For simplicity, we will always choose the pivot to be the first element.(consequences included)
Ex:
![[Pasted image 20240223124609.png]]Order of the left and right sides are not important. But the pivot should be in the correct position of the sorted array.

**Pivot helper Pseudocode,**
1. Function should accept 3 arguments.
	an array
	start index: (Default value = 0)
	end index: (Default value = array.length - 1)
2. Grab the pivot from the start of the array.
3. Store the current pivot index in a variable.
4. Loop through the array from the start until the end.
	If the pivot is greater than the current element, increment the 'pivot index variable' and then swap the current element with the element at the pivot index.
5. Swap the starting element.(pivot) with the pivot index.
6. Return the pivot index.

```js
function pivot(arr, start=0, end=arr.length+1){

	function swap(array, i, j){
		var temp = array[i];
		array[i] = array[j];
		array[j] = temp;
	}

	var pivot = arr[start];
	var swapIdx = start;
	for(var i = start+1; i < arr.length; i++){
		if(pivot > arr[i]){
			swapIdx++;
			swap(arr, swapIdx, i);
		}
	}
	swap(arr, start, swapIdx);
	return swapIdx;
}
```

**Quick sort Pseudocode,**
1. Call the pivot helper on the array.
2. when the helper returns to you the updated pivot index, recursively call the pivot helper on the subarray to the left of that index, and the subarray to the right of that index.
```js
function quickSort(arr, left=0, aright=arr.length-1){
	if(left<right){
		let pivotIndex = pivot(arr, left, right);
		//sort left
		quicksort(arr,left,pivotIdx-1);
		//sort right
		quickSort(arr,pivotIdx+1,right);
	}
	rerurn arr;
}
```

### Big O of Quick Sort

| Time complexity(Best) | Time complexity(Average) | Time complexity(worst) | Space complexity |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| O(n.log n)            | O(n.log n)               | O(n<sup>2</sup>)       | O(log n)         |
**Explain,**
Best case:
![[Pasted image 20240223154334.png]]
If we have 32 items in the array, we have to have 5 levels of decompositions, same as merge sort. 
In each level, we have to make O(n) comparisons. That's happening when we are pivoting. 
All together = **O(n.log n)**

Worst Case:
Our version of quick sort algorithm takes the first element as the pivot. This faces the worst case if the array is already sorted. 
![[Pasted image 20240223160004.png]]
Takes 1 as the pivot.
![[Pasted image 20240223160039.png]]
This decomposition gave us only 1 item and rest is higher than 1. We have the entire right sub array left.
Takes 2 as the pivot.
![[Pasted image 20240223160149.png]]
Each decomposition we go through is only one item we are pivoting on. Everything moves to the right side with our current algorithm.
![[Pasted image 20240223160422.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240223160434.png]]
That is `n` decompositions. Not `log n` like the best case scenario.
And on each level, on each decomposition, we have to make `n` comparisons.
All together = **O(n.n)** = **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**

To avoid this issue, we can write our algorithm to pick a random index or a median index as the pivot always.
