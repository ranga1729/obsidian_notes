This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data. This pattern can tremendously decrease the time complexity.

Ex: Quick sort, Merger sort, Binary search, Binary search tree

Ex: Given a sorted array of integers, write a function called search, that accepts a value and returns the index where the value passed to the function is located.
If the value is not found, return -1.
```
search([1,2,3,4,5,6], 4) // index 3
search([1,2,3,4,5,6], 6) // index 5
search([1,2,3,4,5,6], 11) // -1
```

Naive solution(Linear Search): Time complexity = O(N)
```js
function search(arr, val){
	for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
		if(arr[i] === val){
			return i;
		}
	}
	return -1;
}
```

Refactor(Binary Search): Time complexity = O(Log N)
```js
function search(array, val){
	let min = 0;
	let max = array.length - 1;

	while(min <= max){
		let middle = Math.floor((min+max)/2);
		let currentElement = array[middle];

		if(array[middle] > val){
			min = middle + 1;
		}
		if(array[middle] < val){
			max = middle - 1;
		}
		else{
			return middle;
		}
	}
	return -1;
}
```
Since the array is sorted, at the beginning, we pick the middle of the array.
Ex: [1,2,3,4,5,8,9,12,15,16,29] we are looking for 15. 
middle = 8
so the value we are looking for is more than 8.
then we can ignore the left part of the array completely. 
[9,12,15,16,29]
middle = 15
that's the value we are looking for. 

In this method, every time we divide the array and get the relevant half of the array to proceed and repeat this process.
