Steps of improving your problem solving abilities,
	1. Device a plan for solving problems. (done in previous sections.)
	2. Master common problem solving patterns.(This section.)

There are some common patters that can be applied to multiple problems and common approaches to writing code.

- Patterns of problem solving,
	1. Frequency counter
	2. Multiple Pointer
	3. Sliding Window
	4. Divide and Conquer
	5. Dynamic Programming
	6. Greedy Algorithms
	7. Backtracking and etc....
