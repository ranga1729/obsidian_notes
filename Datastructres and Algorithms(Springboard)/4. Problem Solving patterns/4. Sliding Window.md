This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain  condition the window either increases or closes(and a news windows is created)
Very useful for keeping track of  subset of data in an array/string etc. 

Ex: Write and function called "maxSubarraySum" which accepts an array of integers and a number called 'n'. The function should calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive elements in the array.

Naive Solution: Time complexity = O(N<sup>2</sup>)
```js
fucntion maxSubArryaSum(arr, num){
	if(num > arr.length){
		return null;
	}
	var max = -Infinity;
	for(let i = 0; i < arr.length - num + 1; i++){
		temp = 0;
		for(let j = 0; j < num; j++){
			temp += arr[i + j];
		}
		if(temp > max){
			max = temp;
		}
	}
	return max;
}
```

Refactor: Time Complexity = O(N)
```js
function maxSubArraySum(arr, num){
	let maxSum = 0;
	let tempSum = 0;
	
	if(arr.length < num){
		return null;
	}

	for(let i = 0; i < num; i++){
		maxSum += arr[i];
	}
	tempSum = maxSum;
	for(let i = num; i < arr.length; i++){
		tempSum = tempSum - arr[i-num] + arr[i]; //exlained below
		maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, tempSum);
	}
	return maxSum;
}
```
When we have to sum up consecutive 3 numbers, first we can sum up the first 3 numbers. Then we can subtract the first number and add up the 4th number in order to get the sum of next 3 numbers.
Ex: 
Array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
sum of first 3 numbers(sum) = 1+2+3 = 6
sum of second 3 numbers = sum - first_numer + 4th_numbet
sum of second 3 numbers = 6-1+4 = 9
(This is the sliding window.)

Using this method, we don't have to use nested loops. We can calculate the next sum by the help of the previous sum. We go through the entire array only once.
