It stores any value you want and it's ordered.

Arrays are indexed. We can get whatever the value in the any index we want. A linked lists is consist of nodes and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null. But it's not indexed.
So, a linked lists can not be accessed by indexes.

A linked list contains a head, tail and length property. 
Linked lists consist of nodes and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null. 
	Head: beginning of the linked list.
	tail: end of the list
And also we keep the track of the length.

when we want to access one before the last node, we have to first access the first node, then the second one and move on until we reach at the node we want. 


| Lists                                    | Arrays                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| No indexes.                              | Indexed in order.                            |
| Connected via nodes with a next pointer. | Insertion and deletion can be expensive.     |
| Random access is not allowed.            | Can quickly be accessed at a specific index. |
* Since arrays are indexed, if you remove an element from the middle, every other element has to re-indexed.
