All the sorting algorithms that we were talking about in fall into the group called **Comparison sorting algorithms**.
That means the base comparison we are doing is between 2 items at any given point.

Mathematically there is a lower bound and asymptote for our average time complexity in a comparison sort. So no matter what the actual comparison algorithm is, the best average case time complexity that we can ever hope for in any comparison sort is **n.log n**. 

In certain cases, we can improve this but not with comparisons. 
There are other types of sorting algorithms that are not comparison algorithms, and these algorithms take advantage of special properties of the data.
Radix Sort is a that type of algorithm.

This works on numbers.
It never makes comparisons between elements.
It exploits the fact that information about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits.
Ex: 
a 4 digits number  is bigger than a 2 digits number.

Ex:

First we categorize all of those numbers into buckets based on their last digit.

We do the same process based on their 2nd digit.

An recreate the array keeping the order they in the buckets.
![[Pasted image 20240223214935.png]]
Now bucket them based on the 3rd digit.
![[Pasted image 20240223215151.png]]![[Pasted image 20240223215214.png]]
Bucket them based on the 4th digit.

Now it's sorted.
