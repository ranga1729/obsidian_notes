### What's recursion ?
A process that calls itself and this repetition has some end point. 

Ex:
JSON.parse / JSON.stringify methods use recursion.
DOM traversal algorithms use recursion.

### The call stack
In all programming languages there's a built in data structure that manages what happen when functions are invoked, it maintains the order of thing should happen. 
In JavaScript, it calls **"The call stack."** It's an actual data structure called **"Stack."** 
- Any time a function is invoked, it is placed(**pushed**) on the top of the call stack.
- When JavaScript sees the **return** keyword or when the function is ends, the compiler will remove(**pop**) the top item on the stack.

So, Recursive functions are work in a way that the same function with a different input until you reach your **base case**. 

**Base Case** : The condition when the recursion ends. 

Two essential parts of recursive functions,
1. Base case
2. Different Input

Ex:
```js
function countDwon(num){
	if(num <= 0){
		console.log("All done!");
		return;
	}
	Console.log(num);
	num--;
	dountDown(num);
}
```
```
countDown(3)
Steps,
	1. print 3
	2. countDown(2)
	3. print 2
	4. countDown(1)
	5. print 1
	6. countDown(0) : Base case
	7. print "All done!"
```
This same program can be implemented using a loop,
```js
function countDown(num){
	for(var i = num; i > 0; i--){
		console.log(i);
	}
	console.log("All done!");
}
```


Ex:
```js
function sumRange(num){
	if(num === 1){
		return 1;
	}
	return num + sumRange(num-1);
}
```
Base case : (num === 1)

```
return num + sumRange(num-1)
if num = 3,

return 3 + sumRange(2)
3 + return 2 + sumRange(1)
3 + 2 + return 1
3 + 2 + 1
```

Ex: 
Factorial function.
```js
function factorial(num){
	if(num===1){
		return 1;
	}
	return num*factorial(num-1);
}
```
```
factorial(5)
Steps,
5 * factorial(4)
5 * 4 * factorial(3)
5 * 4 * 3 * factorial(2)
5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1)
5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * return 1
```

### Where things go wrong
- No base case
- Forgetting to return or returning the wrong thing. 
When these errors happens, the console shows "Maximum call stack size exceeded."
This is known as **"Stack Overflow"**(Stack is overflowing with function calls.)

### Helper Method Recursion
This is a design pattern that commonly use with recursion.

Previous examples are single standalone functions and recursive itself. It call itself withing the code. 
In helper method recursion, we have two functions,
1. outer function
2. recursive function
Recursive function is resides in the outer function and it calls itself recursively. That's why it's called helper method recursion.

**Use case:** Commonly done when we need to compile something like and array or a list of data. 
Not suitable for multiplying one value over and over like factorial, summingRange.

Ex:
Collecting all the odd values in an array.
```js
function collectOddValues(arr){
	let result = [];
	//helper method
	function helper(helperInput){
		//check condition
		if(helperInput.length === 0){
			return;
		}
		if(helperInput[0] % 2 !== 0){
			result.push(helperInput[0])
		}
		//recursion initiate
		helper(helperInput.slice(1));
	}
	
	helper(arr);
	return result;
}
```
```
result[] is the empty array we store our odd values in the 'arr' inout array.
In the 'helperInput' method, first it checks whether the inputed array is empty or not. If it's empty, then the recursion will be stopped due to the 'return' statement. 
If it's not empty, first element of the array will be checked for the remainder by 2. If it's not divisible by 2, that element will be added to the 'result' arrya using 'push' method. Then our original inputed array will be sliced by 1(deletes the first element from the array).
This process is recutsive. 
```

### Pure Recursion
Pure recursion means the function itself is totally self contained and it's recursive. 
In pure recursion, We don't use any external data structure like arrays and we don't use any nested function like helper method.
It's just pure recursion.

Ex:
Collecting all the odd values in an array.
```js
function collectOddValues(arr){
	let newArr = [];
	if(arr.length === 0){
		return newArr;
	}
	if(arr[0] % 2 !== 0){
		newArr.push(arr[0]);
	}
	newArr = newArr.concat(collectOddValues(arr.slice(1)));
	return newArr;
}
```
```
Here,each time the recursion happens, newArr[] gets empty. 
collectOddValues([1,2,3,4,5])
Steps,
1 is an odd values. It's get assigned to the newArr.

3. newArr = [1]
Now 'arr' get sliced and recursion happen. New 'newArr' is created.

2. [1].collectOddValues([2,3,4,5])
2 is not an odd number. Get sliced. New 'newArr' is created.

3. [1].collectOddValues([3,4,5])
3 is an odd value. Get sliced. New 'newArr' is created.

4. [1,3].collectOddValues([4,5])
4 is not an odd. Get sliced. New 'newArr' is created.

5. [1,3].collectOddValues([5])
5 is an odd. Get slices. New 'newArr' is created.
arr.lenght is 0. Base case approached.

```
```
collcetOddValues([1,2,3,4,5])
[1].concat(collectOddValues([2,3,4,5]))
	[].concat(collectOddValues([3,4,5]))
		[3]concat(collectOddValues([4,5]))
			[].concat(collectOddValues([5]))
				[5].concat(collectOddValues([]))

Now every steps is goint to resolve from the end to start to do concatenation operations. At the last step, array length is 0, this is the base case and recursion get stopped. Concatenation operations occur.

[5].concat(collectOddValues([]))
[5].concat([])
[5]
	[].concat(collectOddValues([5]))
	[].concat([5])
	[5]
		[3]concat(collectOddValues([4,5]))
		[3]concat([5])
		[5,3]
			[].concat(collectOddValues([3,4,5]))
			[].concat([3,5])
			[5,3]
				[1].concat(collectOddValues([2,3,4,5]))
				[1].concat([3,5])
				[5,3,1]
				Return [5,3,1]
```
- For arrays, use methods lie **slice**, the **spread** operator and **concat** that make copies of arrays so you don't mutate them.
- Since arrays are immutable, you will need to use methods like **slice**, **substr** or **substring** to make copies of strings. 
- To make copies of objects, use **Object.assign** or the **spread operator**.
