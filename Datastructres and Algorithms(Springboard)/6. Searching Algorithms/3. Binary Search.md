- Binary search is much faster form of search.
- Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time.
- Binary search only woks on sorted arrays. 

#### Divide and Conquer
We pick a pivot point in the middle usually, and we check the left side and the right side and see where our desired item will be located on. 

Ex:
Search for 15.
```js
//sorted array
[1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
```
```
We are looking for 15.

Step 1: Select the middle point.(11)
	15 !== 11 and 15 > 11
	We neglect the left side.
	Move on with selecting the right side.
	[12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
Step 2: Select the middle of the previous right side.(17)
	15 !== 17 and 15 < 17
	We neglect the right side this time.
	Move on with the left side.
	[12, 15, 16]
Step 3: Select the middle of the previous left side.(15)
	15 === 15
```

**Pseudo Code:**
- Function accepts a sorted array and a value.
- Creates a left pointer at the start of the array and a right pointer at the end of the array.
- While the left pointer comes before the right pointer: 
	- Creates a pointer in the middle.
	- If you find the value you want, return the index. 
	- If the value is too small, move the left pointer up.
	- If the value is too large, move the right pointer down.
- If you never find the value, return -1.
```js
function binarySearch(arr, elem){
	var start = 0;
	var end = arr.length - 1;
	var middle = Math.floor((start+end)/2)

	while(arr[middle] !== elem && start <= end){
		if(elem < arr[middle]){
			end = middle - 1;
		}else{
			start = middle + 1;
		}
		middle = Math.floor((start+end)/2)
	}
	if(array[middle] === elem){
		return middle;
	}
	return -1;
}
```
```
BinarySearch([2,5,6,9,13,15,28,30], 28)
looking for 28.

[2,5,6,9,13,15,28,30]
 S     M           E

[2,5,6,9,13,15,28,30]
         S   M     E

[2,5,6,9,13,15,28,30]
			   SM  E
(S=M)
```

**Important:**
```js
while(arr[middle] !== elem && start <= end)
```
This is the condition we are using to implement the loop inside the binary search. 
 `start <= end` part is very important to stop this loop running endlessly.
 EX:
```
BinarySearch([2,5,6,9,13,15,28,30], 28)
looking for 50.
```
Now 50 is not in the array.
```
[2,5,6,9,13,15,28,30]
 S     M           E

[2,5,6,9,13,15,28,30]
         S   M     E

[2,5,6,9,13,15,28,30]
			   SM  E
```
When the algorithm comes to the last step above mentioned, 50 is still more than the middle(28).
Now `start` pointer tries to go beyond the middle point by executing `start = midddle + 1`. 
Then start and end pointer collapse. 
To stope this, we use `start <= end`

In this algorithm, our desired element is always caught by the `middle`. That's why it's getting returned at the end. 
But if the element we are looking for is not in the array, we have to return -1. 
```
if(array[middle] === elem){
	return middle;
}
return -1;
```

#### Big O of binary search
Best case: O(1)
Values looking for is at the middle of the array. 

Worst case: O(log n)
At every step we divide the whole array into 2 parts and based on the value we a re looking for, we just pick a side and left the other side.
Ex:
```js
//looking for 13
[2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 14, 15, 19, 21, 25, 28, 30, 50, 52, 60, 63]
middle = 19
//13<19
//take the left side
[2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 14, 15]
middle = 9
//13>9
//take the right side
[11, 14, 15]
middle = 14
//13<14
//take the left side
[11]
middle != 13
```
Array includes 16 elements.
It took 4 steps to realize that 13 isn't here. 
This is the worst case scenario. 

16 element = 4 steps max
32 element = 5 steps max

Every time we double the size of N, we are simply adding one extra step.
