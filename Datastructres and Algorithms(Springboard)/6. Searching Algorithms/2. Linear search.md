Given an array, the simplest wat to search for an value is to look at every element in the array and check if it's the value we want. 

Ex:
Write a function that accepts an array and a value.
Loop through the array and check if the current element is equal to the value.
If it is, return the index at which the element is found.
If the value is never found, return -1.
```js
function(arr, val){
	for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
		if(arr[i] === val){
			return 1;
		}
	}
	return -1;
}
```

#### Linear search BIG O
Best case : O(1)
Found the desired value at the 0th index.

Worst case : O(n) 
Found the desired value at the last index.

As our array gets longer, we have to iterate more elements.
Therefore, Time complexity of linear search is **Big O(n)**.
