Objects are unordered data structures that everything is stored in key value pairs. 

Ex:
```js
let instructor = {
	firstName: "Kelly",
	isInstructor: true,
	favouriteNumber: [1,2,3,4]
}
```
- Ideal to use objects,
	when you don't need order.
	when you need fast access/insertions and removal
#### Big O of objects
- Insertion - **O(1)**
- Removal - **O(1)**
- Searching - **O(N)**
- Access - **O(1)**
	Since we can access values using the key.
When you don't need any ordering, objects are an excellent choice. 

#### Big O of object methods
- Object.keys - **O(N)**
	Ex: Object.keys(instructor)
		["firstName", "isInstructor", "favouriteNumber"]

- Object.values - **O(N)**
	Ex: Object.values(instructor)
		['Kelly', true, Array(4)]

- Object.entries - **O(N)**
	Ex: Object.entries(instructor)
		["firstName", "Kelly"]
		["isInstructor" true]
		["favouriteNumber", Arrya(4)]

- hasOwnProperties - **O(1)**
	Ex: instructor.hasOwnProperty("firstName")
		>true
